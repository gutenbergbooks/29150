<p>The eighty-three years stretching from
1461 to 1543&mdash;between the probable year
of the elder Hans Holbein's birth and that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
which the younger, the great Holbein, died&mdash;constitute
one of those periods which rightly
deserve the much-abused name of an Epoch.
The Christian era of itself had known many:
the Yellow-Danger of the fifth century making
one hideous smear across Europe; the <i>Hic
Jacet</i> with which this same century entombed
an Empire three continents could not content;
the new impulse which Charlemagne and Alfred
had given to Progress in the ninth century; the
triumphant establishment of Papal Supremacy,
that Napoleonic idea of Gregory VII.&mdash;<i>Sanctus
Satanas</i>, of the eleventh, and grand architect
in a vaster Roman Empire which still "humanly
contends for glory"; and lastly, at the very
threshold of the Holbeins, the invention of
movable printing types about 1440, and the fall
of Constantinople in 1453, which combined to
drive the prodigies and potencies of Greek
genius through the world.</p>

<p>Each of these had done its own special work
for the advancement of man&mdash;as for that
matter all things must, whether by help or
helplessness. Not less than Elijah did the
wretched priests of Baal serve those slow,
sure, eternal Purposes, which include an Ahab
and all the futile fury of his little life as the
sun includes its "spots."</p>

<p>But although the stream of History is one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
and its every succeeding curve only an expansion
of the first, there has probably been no
century of our era when this stream has been
so suddenly enlarged, or bent so sharply toward
fresh constellations as in that of the Holbeins,&mdash;when
Religion and Art, as well as Science,
saw a New World upon its astonished horizon.
So that we properly call it a transition period,

<p>Yet we shall never get near to these real
men, to their real world, unless we can forget
all about the pose of this or the other Zeitgeist&mdash;that

<div class="poem">

  <i>Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br />

<p class="noindent">For we must keep constantly in mind that
what we call the Middle Ages or&mdash;worse yet&mdash;the
Dark Ages, made up the Yesterday of the
Holbeins and was the flesh and blood transmitted
to them as their own flesh and blood
with all its living bonds toward the Old and
all its living impulses toward the New.</p>

<p>A now famous New Zealander is, we know,
to sketch our own "medi&aelig;valism" with contemptuous
pity for its darkness. But until his
day comes, our farthing-dips seem to make a
gaudy illumination. And, meantime, we are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
alive; we walk about; we, too, can swell the
chorus which the Initiated chant in every century
with the same fond confidence: "We
alone enjoy the Holy Light."</p>

<p>The New is ever becoming old; the old ever
changing into New. And if we ask why each
waxes or wanes just when it does and as it does,
there is, in the last analysis, no better answer
than Aurora's explanation for chancing on the

  <i>Because the time was ripe.</i>
 </p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And the Holbein century is one of stupendous
Transitions because the time was ripe; and
not simply because printing was invented, or
Greek scholars were driven from Constantinople
to scatter abroad in Europe, or Ferdinand
and Isabella wanted a direct route to Cathay,
or Friar Martin nailed ninety-five Theses to the
door of Wittenberg's church, and built himself
thereby an everlasting name as Luther.</p>

<p>And because the time was ripe for a new
Art, even more than because this or that great
painter entrained it, it also had its transition
period, and Holbein is set down in manuals
as a transitional painter. Teutonic, too; because
all Christian art is either Byzantine or
Italian or Teutonic in its type.</p>

<p>When it first crept from the catacombs under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the protection of the Constantinople Court it
could but be Byzantine; that strange composite
obtained by stripping the Greek "beast" of
every pagan beauty and then decking it out
with crude Oriental ornament. But who that
prizes the peculiar product of that fanaticism
would have had its cradle without this sleepless
terror, lest for the whole world of classic
heathendom it should lose the dear-bought
soul of purely Christian ideals? Or who, remembering
that in thus relentlessly sacrificing
its entire heritage of pagan accumulation it
put back the clock of Art to the Stone Age,
and had to begin all over again in the helpless
bewilderment of untaught childish effort,&mdash;could
find twice ten centuries too long for the
astounding feat it achieved? Ten centuries,
after all, make but a marvellous short course
betwixt the archaic compositions of the third
century and the compositions of Giotto or
Wilhelm Meister.</p>

<p>A great deal of nonsense is talked about the
"tyrannies" which the Monastic Age inflicted
on Art. Of course, monasticism fostered fanaticism.
It does not need the luminous genius
that said it, to teach us that "whatever is necessary
to what we make our sole object is sure, in
some way or in some time or other, to become<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
our master." And with the monk, the true
monk in his day of usefulness, every knowledge
and every art was good or bad according as
it served monastic ideals. But it is absurd
to say that the monk&mdash;<i>qua</i> monk&mdash;"put the
intellect in chains." The whole body of his
oppression was not so paralysing as the iron
little finger of Malherbe and his school of
"classic" despots. To charge upon the monk
the limitations of his crude thought and cruder
methods is about as intelligent as it would be
to fall foul of Shakespeare because boys played
his women's parts.</p>

<p>The springs of Helicon were the monk's also,
as witness Tuotilo and Bernard of Clairvaux;
but it was by the waters of Jordan that his
miracles were wrought. As Johnson somewhere
says of Watts, "every kind of knowledge
was by the piety of his mind converted into
theology." And for the rest,&mdash;by the labour
of his hands, by his fasting from the things of
the flesh, by his lofty faith&mdash;however erring or
forgotten or betrayed, in individual cases,&mdash;by
every impressive lesson of a hard life lived
unto others and a hard death died unto himself,
century after century it was the monk who
taught and helped the barbarian of every land
to turn the desolate freedom of the wild ass into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
a smiling homestead and the savage Africa of
his own heart into at least a better place. The
marvel is that he could at the same time find
room or energy to make his monastery also a
laboratory, a library, and a studio. And yet
he did.</p>

<p>To say that he abhorred Greek ideals is to
say that the shepherd abhors the wolf. His
life was one long fight with the insidious
poison of the Greek. He did not,&mdash;at any rate
in his best days&mdash;believe at all in Art for Art's
sake; and had far too intimate an acquaintance
with the "natural man" to do him even justice.
What he wanted was to <ins title="lacking in original">do</ins> away with him.</p>

<p>Yet with all its repellent features, it is to
this unflinching exclusiveness of the monkish
ideal that we owe one of the most exquisite
blossoms on the stock of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries,&mdash;their innocent and appealing
art; an art as original and as worthy of reverence,
within its own peculiar province, as the
masterpieces of Greece or Italy. You must
turn from the beauty of Antinous to the beauty
of, say, the Saint Veronica, among the works
of the Cologne school at Munich, before you
can estimate the Gulf of many things besides
time which for ever divides the world of the one
from the world of the other. And then you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
must essay to embody the visions of Patmos
with a child's colour-box and brushes, before
you can compare the achievements&mdash;the amazing
achievements&mdash;of the monkish ideal with
the achievements of classic paganism.</p>

<p>With the school of Wilhelm Meister this
tremendous revolution had accomplished itself;
and solely through the indomitable will of the
monk. The ideal of Greece had been to show
how gods walk the earth. This Christian ideal
was to show how devout men and women walk
with God. Their ineffable heavenly faces look
out from their golden world&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="noindent"><i>Inviolate, unwearied,<br />
Divinest, sweetest, best,</i>
</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">upon this far-off, far other world, where nothing
is inviolate, and divinest things must come at
last to tears and ashes.</p>

<p>But the monk had had his day as well as his
way. The so-called Gothic architecture had expressed
its uttermost of aspiration and tenuity;
and painting had fulfilled its utmost accommodation
to the ever more slender wall-spaces and
forms which this architecture necessitated. And
once again, in the fifteenth century, the time
was ripe for a new transition. Art was now
to reveal the realities of this world, and to
concern itself with Man among them. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
just as the law of reaction flung the mind
into religious revolt from the outworn dogmas
and overgrown pretensions of the monkish
ideal, so did it drive the healthy reaction of art
into its own extravagances of protest. And
we shall see how even a genius like Holbein's
was unable to entirely free itself from this reactionary
defect. For with all his astonishing
powers, imaginative and technical, he never
wholly overcame that defect of making his
figures too short and too thick-set for grace,
which amounted to a deformity in the full-length
figures of his early work, and was due
to his fierce revolt from the unnaturally elongated
forms of an earlier period.</p>

<p>Yet we should make a grave mistake if we
were to regard Holbein as cut off by this
reaction from all affinities with the monkish
ideals of the Cologne school. On the contrary.
We shall see, especially in his religious pictures,
how many of those ideals had fed the very
springs of his imagination and sunk deep into
his art; only expressing themselves in his own
symbolism and in forms unlike theirs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Augsburg Gallery there is a painting
by Holbein's father, the "Basilica of St. Paul,"
in which there is a group introduced after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
fashion of the period, which has a special
biographical interest. This group, in the
Baptism of St. Paul, is believed by many
authorities to be a portrait-group of the painter
himself,&mdash;Hans Holbein the Elder, and his two
young sons, Ambrose (or Amprosy, as it was
often written) and Johannes, or "Hanns." The
portrait of the father is certainly like Holbein's
own drawing of him in the Duke d'Aumale's
Collection, which Sandrart engraved in his
account of the younger Holbein; while the
heads of the two boys are very like those
which we shall find later in a drawing in the
Berlin Gallery. From the pronounced way in
which his father's hand rests on little Hans'
head, while the left points him out,&mdash;and even
his elder brother "Prosy" shows by his attitude
the special notice to be taken of Hans,&mdash;it
is clear that if this is a portrait-group either
it was painted when the boys were actually
older, or the younger had already given some
astonishing proof of that precocity which his
early works display; for in this group the
younger boy cannot be more than eight or
nine years old.</p>

<p>Hans Holbein the Elder, who stands here
with his long brown hair and beard falling
over his fur gown, was a citizen of Augsburg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
living for a while in the same street with the
honoured Augsburg painter, Hans Burgkmair,
and occasionally working with him on large
commissions. That he was a native of Augsburg,
and the son&mdash;as is generally believed&mdash;of
"Michel Holbain" (Augsburg commonly
spelt <i>Holbein</i> with an <i>a</i>), leather-dresser&mdash;I
myself cannot feel so sure as others do. There
is no documentary evidence to prove that the
Michael Holbein of Augsburg ever had a son,
and there is both documentary and circumstantial
evidence to prove that the descendants
of Hans Holbein the Elder claimed a different
origin. That a man was a "citizen," or
burgher, of any town, of course proves nothing.
It was a period when painters especially learned
their trades and practised it in many centres.
And this, when guilds were all-powerful and
no one could either join one without taking
citizenship with it, or pursue its calling in any
given place without association with the guild
of that place, often involved a series of citizenships.
The elder Holbein was himself a burgher
of Ulm at one time, if not of other cities in
which he worked.</p>

<p>But that Augsburg was his fixed home for
the greater part of his life is certain; and the
rate-books show that after the leather-dresser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
had disappeared from their register of residents
in the retail business quarter of the city, in
the neighbourhood of the Lech canals, Hans
Holbein the Elder was, in 1494, a householder
in this very place. For some years the name
of "Sigmund, his brother," is bracketed with
his; but about 1517 Sigmund Holbein established
himself in Berne, where he accumulated a
very respectable competence, which, at his death
in 1540, he bequeathed to his "dear nephew,
Hans Holbein, the painter," at that time a
citizen of Basel. Sigmund also was a painter,
but no unquestioned work of his is known.</p>

<p>There is nothing to show who was the wife
of Sigmund Holbein's elder brother, Hans.
But by 1499 this elder Hans had either a child
or children mentioned with him (<i>sein kind</i>,
applying equally to one or more). In all probability
this is the earliest discoverable record
of Hans Holbein the Younger, and his elder
brother Ambrose. In all probability, too,
Hans was then about two years old, and
"Prosy" a year or two older. At one time
it was vaguely thought that the elder Hans
had three sons; and Prosy, or "Brosie," as it
was sometimes written, got converted into a
"Bruno" Holbein. But no vestige of an
actual Bruno is to be found. And as Ambrose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Holbein's trail, whether in rate-books or art-records,
utterly vanishes after 1519, it will be
seen that for the most part of the younger
Holbein's life he had no brother. Hence it
is easy to understand how his uncle Sigmund's
Will speaks only of "my dear nephew."</p>

<p>Hans the elder lived far on in his younger
son's life. His works attest that he had talents
and ideals of no mean order. But I do not
propose to enter here upon the vexed question
as to how far the "Renaissance" characteristics
of the later works attributed to his hand are
his own or his son's. Learned and exhaustive
arguments have by turns consigned the best of
these works to the father, to the son, and back
again to the father. In at least one instance
of high authority the same writer has, at different
periods, held a brief for both sides and for
opposite opinions! In this connection, as on
the battlefield of some of the son's greatest
paintings, the single-minded student of Holbein
may not unprofitably draw three conclusions
from the copious literature on the subject:&mdash;First,
that a working hypothesis is not of
necessity the right one; secondly, that in the
matter of his pronouncements the critical expert
also may occasionally be regarded as</p>

<p>
<i>Un animal qui s'habille, d&eacute;shabille et babille toujours;</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>and thirdly, that in default of incontestable
documentary proofs the modest "so far as I
have been able to discover" of Holbein's first
biographer, Van Mander, is a capital anchor
to windward, and is at any rate preferable to
driving forth upon the howling waters of
Classification, like Constance upon the Sea
of Greece, "Alle sterelesse, God wot."</p>

<p>But my chief reason for not pursuing the
Protean phantom of Holbein's Augsburg period
is that,&mdash;apart from my own disagreement with
many accepted views about the works it includes,
and the utter lack of data for determining
any position irrefutably,&mdash;it is comparatively
unimportant to the purpose of this little book.
For wherever the younger painter was born,&mdash;whether
at Augsburg or Ulm or elsewhere,&mdash;and
whatever I believe to be his rightful claim
to such paintings as the St. Elizabeth and St.
Barbara of the St. Sebastian altar-piece at
Munich, Fame, like Van Mander, has rightly
written him down Holbein <i>Basiliensis</i>.</p>

<p>It is true that his father's brushes were his
alphabet. It may be true, though I doubt it,
that his father's teaching was his only technical
school. But if he was, as to the last he gloried
in being, the child of the Old Period, he was
much more truly the immediate pupil of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Van Eycks than of his father's irresolute
ideals; while Basel was his university. And
whatever may have been his debt to those
childish years when the little Iulus followed
his father with trembling steps, his debt to
Basel was immensely greater. The door-sill
of Johann Froben's printing-house was the
threshold of his earthly immortality.</p>

<p>When he turned his back on the low-vaulted
years of Augsburg, it was because for him also
the time was ripe. The Old Period had cast
his genius; the New was to expand it to new
powers and purposes.</p>

<p class="poem">
<i><span class="ind6">Still, as the spiral grew,</span><br />
He left the past year's dwelling for the new;<br />

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may easily have been the elder Hans'
continuous troubles, whether due to his fault
or his misfortune it is idle now to inquire,
which made his sons leave Augsburg. Certain
it is that he but escaped from the clutches of
one suit for debt after another in order to
tumble into some fresh disaster of the sort,
until his own brother Sigmund appears among
his exasperated creditors. After 1524 Hans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Holbein the Elder vanishes from the records.
Probably, therefore, it was at about this date
that he paid,&mdash;Heaven and himself only knowing
how willingly,&mdash;the one debt which every
man pays at the last.</p>

<p>At all events his sons did leave Augsburg
about 1514; or, at any rate, Hans did, since
there is a na&iuml;ve little Virgin and Child in the
Basel Museum, dated 1514, which must have
been painted in the neighbourhood of Constance
in this year,&mdash;probably for the village church
where it was discovered. As everything points
to the conclusion that Holbein was born in
1497, he would have been some seventeen years
old at this time, and "Prosy" eighteen or
nineteen. Substantially, therefore, they must
have looked pretty much as in the drawing
which their father had made of them three
years before; that precious drawing in silver-point
which is now in the Berlin Collection
(<a href="#hpl2">Plate 2</a>). Over the elder, still with the curly
locks of the group in the "St. Paul Basilica," is
written <i>Prosy</i>; over the younger, <i>Hanns</i>. The
age of the latter, fourteen, may still be deciphered
above his portrait, but that of Ambrose has
quite vanished. Between the two is the family
name, written in Augsburg fashion, Holbain.
At the top of the sheet stands the year of
the drawing, almost illegible, but believed to
be 1511.<a name="himg2" id="himg2"></a><a name="hpl2" id="hpl2"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the elder brother all that is certainly
known may be said here once for all. In 1517
he entered the Painters' Guild at Basel, where
he is called "Ambrosius Holbein, citizen of
Augsburg." He made a number of designs
for wood-engraving, title-pages, and ornaments,
for the printers of Basel&mdash;all of fair
merit. He may also have worked in the studio
of Hans Herbster, a Basel painter of considerable
note. Herbster's portrait in oils, long held
to be a fine work of the younger brother,&mdash;now
that it has passed from the Earl of Northbrook's
collection to that of the Basel Museum, is
attributed to Ambrose Holbein. But little else
is known of him; and after 1519, as has been
said, the absence of any record of him among
the living suggests that he died in that year.</p>

<p>In the late summer of 1515 came that
momentous trifle which has for ever linked
the name of young Hans Holbein with that
of Erasmus. Whether, as some say, the
scholar gave him the order, or, as seems more
likely, some friend of both had the copy, now
in the Basel Museum, on the margins of which
the lad drew his spirited pen-and-ink sketches,&mdash;it
is on record that they were made before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
end of December, and that Erasmus himself
was delighted with their wit and vigour. And,
in truth, they are exceedingly clever, both in
the art with which a few strokes suggest a
picture, and in that by which the picture emphasises
every telling point in the satire. But
a great deal too much has been built upon
both the satire and the sketches; a great deal,
also, falsely built upon them.</p>

<p>They have been made to do duty, in default
of all genuine proofs, as supports to the theory
by which Protestant writers have claimed both
Erasmus and Holbein as followers of Luther
in their hearts, without sufficient courage or
zeal to declare themselves such. I confess
that, though myself no less ardent as a Protestant
than as an admirer of Holbein, I
cannot, for the life of me, see any justification
for either the claim or its implied charge of
timorousness.</p>

<p>Erasmus's <i>Praise of Folly</i>&mdash;like so many
a paradox started as a joke,&mdash;had no notion
of being serious at all until it was seriously
attacked. Some four years before its illustrations
riveted the name of a stripling artist
to that of the world-renowned scholar, Erasmus
had fallen ill while a guest in the sunny Bucklersbury
home where three tiny daughters and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
a baby son were the darlings of Sir Thomas
More and his wife. To beguile the tedium of
convalescence the invalid had scribbled off a
jeu d'esprit, with its punning play on More's
name, <i>Encomium Mori&aelig;</i>, in which every theme
for laughter, in a far from squeamish day,
was collected under that title. Read aloud to
More and his friends, it was declared much too
good to be limited to private circulation; and
accordingly, with some revision and expansion,
it was printed. That it scourged with its
mockery those things in both Church and State
which Erasmus and More and many another
fervent Churchman hated,&mdash;such as the crying
evils which called aloud for reformation in the
highest places, and above all, that it lashed
the detested friars whom the best churchmen
most loathed,&mdash;these things were foregone
conclusions in such a composition. But a
laugh, even a satirical laugh, at the expense
of excrescences or follies in one's camp, is a
very far cry from going over to its foes. As a
huge joke Erasmus wrote the <i>Praise of Folly</i>;
as such More and all his circle lauded it; as
such Froben reprinted it; and as such young
Holbein pointed all its laughing gibes.</p>

<p>And it was part and parcel of the joke that
he launched his own sly arrow at the author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
himself. Erasmus could but laugh at the
adroitness with which the young man from
Augsburg had drawn a reverend scholar
writing away at his desk, among the votaries
of Folly, and written <i>Erasmus</i> over his head.
But it was hardly to be expected that he should
altogether relish the witty implication, or the
presumption of the unknown painter who had
ventured to make it. Nor did he. Turning
over a page he also contrived to turn the laugh
yet once again, this time against the too-presuming
artist. Finding, perhaps, the coarsest
of the sketches, one in keeping with the "fat
and splendid pig from the drove of Epicurus,"
he in his turn wrote the name of <i>Holbein</i> above
the wanton boor at his carousals. It was a
reprisal not more delicate than the spirit with
which subjects too sacred to have been named
in the same breath with Folly,&mdash;the very words
of our Lord Himself,&mdash;had been dragged into
such company. But though it, too, was a
joke, this little slap of wounded amour propre
has found writers to draw from it an entire
theory that Holbein led a life of debauchery!</p>

<p>Yet even this feat of deduction is surpassed
by that which argues that because Erasmus
and Holbein lashed bad prelates and vicious
monks with satire, therefore they detested the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
whole hierarchy of Rome and loathed all monks,
good or bad. "Erasmus laid the egg which
Luther hatched" is the oft-repeated cry; forgetting
or ignoring the plain fact that Erasmus
eyed the Lutheran egg with no little mistrust
in its shell and with unequivocal disgust in its
full-feathered development. "What connection
have I with Luther," he writes some
three years after Holbein illustrated Stultitia's
worshippers, "or what recompense have I to
expect from him that I should join with him
to oppose the Church of Rome, which I take
to be the true part of the Church Catholic,
or to oppose the Roman Pontiff who is the
head of the Catholic Church? I am not so
impious as to dissent from the Church nor
so ungrateful as to dissent from Leo, from
whom I have received uncommon favour and
indulgence."</p>

<p>As to Holbein's "Protestant sympathies"&mdash;using
the name for the whole Lutheran movement
in which Protestantism had its rise,&mdash;the
assertions are even less grounded in fact, if
that be possible. If he had it not already in
his heart, through Erasmus and Amerbach and
Froben and More and every other great influence
to which he yielded himself at all, he
early acquired a deep and devout sense of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
need of reform <i>within</i> the Church. Like all
these lifelong friends, he wanted to see the
Church of Rome return to her purer days and
cast off the corruptions of a profligate idleness.
Like them he couched his lance against the
unworthy priest, the gluttonous or licentious
monk, the wolves in sheep's clothing that
were destroying the fold from within. Like
them, as they re-echoed Colet&mdash;the saintly Dean
of St. Paul's,&mdash;he passionately favoured the
translation of the Scriptures into the vernacular
and placing them in the hands, or at any rate
bringing them to the familiar knowledge, of
peasant as well as prelate. But surely one
must know very little of the teachings of
the stoutest Churchmen of Holbein's day and
acquaintance not to know also that they encouraged
if they did not plant these opinions
in his mind.</p>

<p>"D&uuml;rer's woodcuts and engravings, especially
his various scenes from the Passion,"
writes even Woltmann, the biographer to
whom every student of Holbein owes so grateful
a debt, "had prepared the soil among the
people for Luther's translation of the Bible.
Holbein's pictures from the Old Testament
followed in their wake, and helped forward the
work." Yet it seems difficult to suppose that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Woltmann could have been ignorant of the
facts of the case. So far were Holbein's,
or any other artist's, Bible illustrations or
Bible pictures from arguing a "Lutheran"
monopoly in the vernacular Bible, that in Germany
alone there were fifteen translated and
illustrated editions of the Bible before Luther's
appeared; and of these fifteen some half-dozen
were published before Luther was born.
Quentell, at Cologne, for instance, published
a famous translation with exceedingly good
woodcuts in 1480,&mdash;three years before Luther's
birth. While some nine years before Quentell's
German translation, the Abbot Niccolo Malermi
published his <i>Biblia Vulgare</i> in the Italian vernacular,
which went through twenty editions
in less than a century: one of which,&mdash;brought
out at Venice in 1490 by the Giunta Brothers,&mdash;was
illustrated by woodcuts of the greatest
beauty. So widespread was the demand for
this "Malermi Bible" that another edition,
with new illustrations of almost equal merit,
was produced at Venice in 1493, by the printer
known as <i>Anima Mia</i>. All of these were
vernacular Bibles; all illustrated; all widely
known throughout Italy and Germany before
Holbein was born or Luther was in his tenth
year. And certainly it has not yet been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
suggested by the most rabid Protestantism that
either these or any of the many other illustrated
vernacular Bibles printed long before
Luther's great translation,&mdash;a translation with
a special claim to immortality because it may
be said to have set the standard for modern
German,&mdash;were anything but Roman Catholic
Bibles. They were translated and illustrated
in behalf of no doctrine which Protestantism
does not hold in common with the Church of
Rome.</p>

<p>To lose hold of these things, to lose sight of
the true attitude of Holbein in his Bible woodcuts
and his "Images of Death," or of either
Erasmus or Holbein in their satires on the
flagrant abuses within their Church, and their
unwavering devotion to that Church,&mdash;is to
deliberately throw away the clue to the most
vital qualities in the work of either, and to the
whole course and character of Holbein himself,
no less than to that of his lifelong friend and
benefactor.</p>

<p>In 1515 the young painter who had come to
Basel to better his fortunes painted a table
for Hans B&auml;r's wedding. The bridegroom
marched away, carrying the Basel colours, to
the bloody field of Marignano (or Melegnano)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
in this same year, and never came back to sit
with his smiling bride around Holbein's most
amusing conceits&mdash;where "Saint Nobody" was
depicted among all the catastrophes of which
he is the scapegoat, and a few ordinary trifles&mdash;a
letter, a pair of spectacles, etc.&mdash;were marvellously
represented, as if dropped by chance
above the painted decorations, so that people
were always attempting to pick them up. But
Hans B&auml;r's sister had been the first wife of a
certain brave comrade&mdash;Meyer "of the Hare,"
who did come back and played an important part
in young Holbein's career. Long lost among
forgotten rubbish, Hans B&auml;r's table has been
unearthed, and is now preserved in the town
library at Zurich.</p>

<p>But although Holbein had got his foot on
the ladder of fame in this year's beginning
of his connection with Froben, he was as yet
very thankful to accept any commission, however
humble. And as a human document there
is a touch of peculiar, almost pathetic interest
about the Schoolmaster's Signboard preserved
by Bonifacius Amerbach, and now with his collection
in the Basel Museum (<a href="#hpl3">Plate 3</a>). It is
a simple thing, with no pretension to a place
among "works of art"&mdash;this bit of flotsam
from 1516, when it was painted. Originally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the two views, the Infant Class and the Adult
Class, were on opposite sides of the sign; but
they have been carefully split apart so as to
be seen side by side. In the one is the quaint
but usual Dame's School of the period; in the
other the public is informed how the adults
of Basel may retrieve the lack of such early
opportunities. The inscription above each sets
forth how whosoever wishes to do so can be
taught to read and write correctly, and be
furnished with all the essentials of a decent
education at a very moderate cost; "children
on the usual terms." And there is a delightful
clause to say that "if anyone is too dull-witted
to learn at all, no payment will be accepted,
be it Burger or Apprentice, Wife or Maid."</p>

<p>Somehow, looking at the young fellow at
the right of the table, in the Adult Class,
sitting facing the anxious schoolmaster, with
his own brow all furrowed by the effort to
follow him and his mouth doggedly set to
succeed,&mdash;while the late, low sun of a summer
afternoon streams in through the leaded window,&mdash;one
muses on the chance that so may
the young painter from Augsburg, now but
nineteen, himself have sat upon this very
bench and leaned across this very table, in
a like determination to widen out his small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
store of book-learning. He could have had
little opportunity to do so in the ever-shifting,
bailiff-haunted home of his boyhood. And
somewhere he certainly learned to write quite
as well as even the average gentleman of his
day; witness the notes on his drawings.<a name="himg3" id="himg3"></a><a name="hpl3" id="hpl3"></a></p>

<p>Somewhere, too, and no later than these
first Basel years, he acquired the power to
read and appreciate even the niceties of Latin,
though he probably could not have done more
than make these out to his own satisfaction.
All his work of illustration is too original, too
spontaneous, too full of flashes of subtle personal
sympathy with the text, to have emanated
from an interpreter, or been dictated by another
mind than his own. And this very Signboard
may have paid for lessons which he could not
otherwise afford. For if there is any force in
circumstantial evidence it is certain that Holbein
not only wrote, but read and pondered
and thought for himself in these years when
he doubtless had many more hours of leisure
than he desired, from a financial standpoint.</p>

<p>And the greatest pages of his autobiography,
written with his brush, will be only so many
childish rebuses if we forget what astounding
pages of History and Argument were turned
before him. In Augsburg he had seen the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Emperor Maximilian riding in state more than
once, and heard much talk about that Emperor's
interests and schemes and fears; and of thrones
and battlefields engaged with or against these.
Augsburg was in closest ties of commerce with
Venice; and the tides of many a tremendous
issue of civilisation rolled to and fro through
the gates of the Free Swabian City.</p>

<p>Child and lad, his was a precocious intelligence;
and it had been fed upon meat for
strong men. He had heard of Alexander VI.'s
colossal infamies, and those of C&aelig;sar Borgia
as well; and of the kingdoms ranging to this
or that standard after the death of Pope and
Prince. He was nine years old then. Old
enough, too, to drink in the wonderful hero-tales
of one Christopher Columbus of Genoa,
whose fame was running through the Whispering
Gallery of Europe, while he himself lay
dying at Valladolid&mdash;ill, heartbroken, poor,
disgraced,&mdash;yet proudly confident that he had
demonstrated, past all denial, the truth of his
own conviction, and touched the shores of
Cathay, sailing westward from Spain. Da
Gama, Vespucci, Balboa, Magellan,&mdash;theirs
were indeed names and deeds to set the heart
of youth leaping, between its cradle and its
twenty-fifth year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Holbein was twelve when Augsburg heard
that England had a young king, whom it
crowned as Henry VIII. He was setting out
from his home, such as it was, to fight his
own boyish battle of Life, when the news
spread of Flodden's Field. None of these
things would let such an one as he was rest
content to apprehend them as a yokel. From
either the honest dominie of the Signboard
or some other, we may be sure he sought
the means to read and digest them for himself.
And if he learnt some smattering of
the geography of the earth and the heavens
after the crude notions of an older day, he
could have done no other, at that time, in
the most enlightened Universities. Ptolemy's
<i>Geographia</i> was still the text-book, and the
so-called "Ptolemaic Theory" still the astronomical
creed of scholars. Copernicus
was, indeed, a man of forty when Holbein
was painting this Signboard in 1516. But
Copernicus was still interluding the active
duties of Frauenburg's highly successful governor,
tax-collector, judge, and vicar-general,&mdash;to
say nothing of his brilliant essays on finance,&mdash;with
those studies in his watch-tower which
were to revolutionise the astronomical conceptions
of twenty centuries and wheel the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Earth around the Sun instead of the Sun around
the Earth. But his system was not actually
published until its author was on his death-bed,
in the year of Holbein's own death. So
that these stupendous new ideas were only
the unpublished rumours and discussions of
circles like that of Froben and Erasmus, when
Holbein first entered it.</p>

<p>But it is no insignificant sidelight on the
history of this circle and this period to recall
that the subversive theories of Copernicus,&mdash;far
as even he was from anticipating how a
Kepler and a Newton should one day shatter
the "Crystalline Spheres," and relegate to the
dustheap of antiquity the "Epicycles," to which
he still clung,&mdash;had their only generous hearing
from influential churchmen of Rome. Luther
recoiled from them as the blasphemies of "an
arrogant fool"; and even Melanchthon urged
that they should be "suppressed by the secular
arm." Nor let it be forgotten that these
matters were never a far cry from those Basel
printing-presses where the greatest master-printers
were themselves thorough and eager
scholars; "Men of Letters," in the noblest
sense of the word. And the discussion of all
these high concerns of history and letters was
as much a part of the daily life surging around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
their printing-presses as the roar of the Rhine
was in the air of Basel.</p>

<p>As has been said, the sister of that Hans
B&auml;r for whom Holbein painted the "St. Nobody"
table had been the first wife, Magdalena
B&auml;r&mdash;a widow with one daughter, when she
married him&mdash;of Jacob Meyer,<a href="#fn2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a><a name="fn2r" id="fn2r"></a> "of the Hare"
(<i>zum Hasen</i>). Magdalena died in 1511, and
about 1512 Meyer zum Hasen married Dorothea
Kannegiesser. And now in 1516, a
memorable year to Holbein on account of this
influential patron, the young stranger was
commissioned to paint the portraits of Meyer
(<a href="#hpl4">Plate 4</a>) and his second wife, Dorothea (<a href="#hpl5">Plate
5</a>). These oil paintings, and the drawings for
them, are now in the Basel Museum. And no
one can examine them, remembering that the
painter was but nineteen, without echoing the
exclamation of a brilliant French writer:
"Holbein ira beaucoup plus loin dans son
art, mais d&eacute;j&agrave; il est superbe." These warm
translucent browns are instinct with life and
beauty.<a name="himg4" id="himg4"></a><a name="himg5" id="himg5">

<p>Against the rich Renaissance architecture
and the blue of the sky-vista the massive head
of Meyer and the blonde one of his young
wife,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&mdash;the latter so expressive of half-proud, half-shy
consciousness,&mdash;stand out in wonderful
vigour. From the scarlet cap on his thickly
curling brown hair to the piece of money
between his thumb and finger, the Burgomaster's
picture is a virile and masterly portrait.
And just as forcefully is the charm of
his pretty wife,&mdash;with all her bravery of scarlet
frock, gold embroidery, head-dress and chains,&mdash;her
own individual charm. They are both as
much themselves in this fine architectural setting
as in their own good house "of the Hare"
which adjoined the rising glories of the new
Renaissance "Council Hall" (<i>Rathaus</i>) in which
Meyer was to preside so often.</p>

<p>In 1516 he had just been elected Mayor for
the first time; but after this he had many
consecutive re-elections in the alternate years
which permitted this. For no burgomaster
could hold office for two years in actual succession.
Previous to being Mayor he had
been an eminent personage as master of the
guilds. And both before and after his mayoralty
he was a distinguished soldier,&mdash;rising
from ensign to captain in the Basel contingent
which served at different times among the
Auxiliaries of France and of the Pope.</p>

<p>But what made this election of 1516 a civic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
epoch was that Meyer zum Hasen (there were
many unrelated Meyers in Basel, and two
among Holbein's patrons, who must be carefully
distinguished according to the name of
the house each occupied) was the first Burgomaster
ever elected in this city from below the
knightly rank. While the piece of money in
his hand, far from fulfilling the absurd purpose
sometimes suggested,&mdash;that of showing his
claim to wealth!&mdash;marks another civic event
of this year. For it was on the 10th of January,
1516, that the Emperor Maximilian had
just issued the Charter which gave to Basel
the right to mint her own gold coins. In the
painting the pose of Meyer's right hand has
been altered, and the position which Holbein
originally gave it can still be made out.
The monogram and date are on the background.</p>

<p>In accordance with his invariable rule for
portraits in oils, Holbein first made a careful
drawing of each head on the same scale as
the finished picture, carrying it out with great
freedom but at the same time with astonishing
care and finish. So that his studies for portraits
are themselves works of art, sometimes
invested with even more spirit than the oil
painting, which was never made direct from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the living model,&mdash;at any rate, until ready for
the finishing touches. Drawn with a point which
could give a line as bold or as almost impalpable
as he wished, and modelled to the very
texture of the surfaces, the carnations are so
sufficiently indicated or rendered with red chalk
as to serve every purpose. Sometimes notes
are also added. Thus in the upper corner of
the drawing for Meyer's head the artist has
noted "eyebrows lighter than the hair" in his
microscopic yet firm writing.</p>

<p>With these fine portraits, painted as if
united by the same architectural background,
Holbein began a friendship of many years.
After some four centuries it is not possible to
produce written records of such ties except in
occasional corroborative details. But neither
is it possible to mistake the painted records of
repeated commissions. While as the lifelong
leader of the Catholic party in Basel, it was
natural that Meyer zum Hasen should have
much in common with a painter who all his life
held firmly to his friendships with the most
conspicuous champions of that party.</p>

<p>Johann Froben was another of these; and
from 1515 until Froben's death eleven years
later Holbein had more and more to do for
this printer. Occasionally, too, he drew for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
other Basel printers; but not often. The
eighty-two sketches on the margins of that
priceless copy of the <i>Praise of Folly</i>, which
Basel preserves in her Museum, had been
suited to their company. Admirable, though
unequal, as are their merits, they <i>are</i> sketches,
whose chief beauty is their happy spontaneity.
Such things are among the trifles of art, and
are not to be put into the scales at all with the
finished perfection of his serious designs for
wood engraving. These were drawn on the
block; and even these cannot properly represent
the drawing itself except when cut by some such
master hand as his own. Since in preparing
the design for printing the background is cut
away, leaving the composition itself in lines of
relief,&mdash;it follows that everything, so far as the
reproduction is concerned, must depend upon
the cleanness and delicacy of the actual cutting.
A clouded eye, a fumbling touch, and the most
ethereal idea becomes its travesty&mdash;the purest
line debased. Hence the necessity for taking
the knife into consideration in judging such
work.</p>

<p>This is not the place for any fraction of that
hot debate which Kugler ironically styles "the
great question of the sixteenth century"; the
debate as to whether Holbein himself did or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
did not cut any of his own blocks. Assuredly
he could do so. The exquisite adjustment of
every line to its final purpose, the masterly
understanding of the proper limitations and
field of every effect, all prove that he had an
unerring knowledge of the craft no less than of
the art of Illustration. But in his day that
craft, like every other, had its own guild; and
it would not have been likely to tolerate any
intrusion on its rights.</p>

<p>We know, too, that those woodcuts which
most attest Holbein's genius were engraved
by that mysterious "Hans L&uuml;tzelburger, form-cutter,
called Franck" (<i>Hans L&uuml;tzelburger,
Formschnider, genannt Franck</i>), who still remains,
after all the researches of enthusiastic
admirers, a hand and a name, and beyond this&mdash;nothing.
But it is when Holbein's designs
are engraved with L&uuml;tzelburger's astonishingly
beautiful cutting that we can appreciate how
wonderful was the design itself. To compare
these fairy pictures with the painter's large cartoons
is to get some conception of the arc his
powers described. It seems incredible that the
same hand could hang an equal majesty on
the wall of a tiny shell and on that of a king's
palace, and with equal justness of eye. Yet
it is done. He will ride a donkey or an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
elephant with the like mastery; but you will
never find Holbein saddling the donkey with a
howdah.</p>

<p>It is not always possible to subscribe to
Ruskin's flowing judgments; but I gratefully
borrow the one with which he sums up thus,
in a lecture on wood-engraving: Holbein
does not give many gradations of light, the
speaker says, "but not because Holbein cannot
give chiaroscuro if he chooses. He is
twenty times a stronger master of it than
Rembrandt; but therefore he knows exactly
when and how to use it, and that wood-engraving
is not the proper means for it. The
quantity of it which is needful for his story
he will give, and that with an unrivalled
subtlety."</p>

<p>And the student of Holbein's art can but
feel that Ruskin has here touched upon a
characteristic of the painter's peculiar power
in every phase of it;&mdash;the power to be C&aelig;sar
within himself; to say to his hand, "thus far,"
to say to his fancy, "no farther." Those who
have come to know Holbein something more
than superficially, or as a mere maker of
portraits, will smile at the dictum of some
very recent "authority" which pronounces
him wanting in imagination; or at the hasty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
conclusion that what he <i>would</i> not, that he
could not.</p>

<p>He has given us, for instance, no animal
paintings or landscapes pure and simple, or, at
least, none such have come down to us. And
yet what gems of landscape he has touched
into his backgrounds here and there! And
what drawings of animal life he made! There
are two, for instance, in the Basel Museum
which could not be surpassed; studies in silver-point
and water-colours of lambs and a bat
outstretched. No reproduction could give the
exquisite texture of the bat's wings, the
wandering red veins, the almost diaphanous
membrane, the furry body,&mdash;a miracle of
patience and softness. It is all purest Nature.
Like Topsy one can but "'spec' it growed"
rather than was created.</p>

<p>And they are not only beautiful in themselves
but full of living meanings. Many an hour the
young painter enjoyed while he made such
studies as his lambs on the pleasant slopes
about Basel; the mountains scalloping the
horizon, and all the sweet fresh winds vocal
with tinkling bells or the chant of the deep-throated
Rhine. Many of "the long, long
thoughts" of youth,&mdash;those thoughts that ring
like happy bells or sweep like rushing rivers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
kept him company as he laid these delicate
strokes and washes that seem to exhale the
very breath of morning across four hundred
years.</p>

<p>In the next year after painting the portraits
of Meyer and his wife there is a sudden break
in the painter's story which has always puzzled
his biographers. After such a brilliant start
in Basel it is perplexing to find the young man,
instead of proceeding to join the Painters'
Guild and take the necessary citizenship, suddenly
turn his back on all these encouragements
and leave the town for a long absence
and remote journeys. As will be seen when
we come to consider the story of Holbein's
married life, however, I have a theory that
the influence which sent him south in such
an unexpected fashion was apart from professional
affairs.</p>

<p>Whether this is a good shot or no, certain
it is that he did now go far south,&mdash;as distances
were in those days; and that, paying his way
as he went by his brush, he went first to
Lucerne, where the evidence goes to show
that he apparently thought of settling instead
of at Basel,&mdash;and then on beyond it. And it
seems highly probable that at this time he
pushed on over the Alps and made his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
way into Italy,&mdash;already the Mecca of every
artist.</p>

<p>Here he could not now, in 1517, have hoped
to see either Bramante or Leonardo da Vinci
in person. The former had died at Rome two
years before; but, without getting even as
far as Pavia, Milan could show some splendid
monuments to his sojourn within her walls;
characteristic examples of that architecture
of the closing fifteenth century which Holbein
loved as Bramante himself. Leonardo was
now in France; but in the refectory of the
Santa Maria Monastery was his immortal,
though, alas! not imperishable, masterpiece&mdash;"The
Last Supper." Time had not yet taught
Leonardo, much less Holbein, the fleeting
nature of mural oil-painting; the only so-called
"fresco" painting which the latter ever attempted,
so far as is known. But the great
Supper was still glowing in all the splendour
of its original painting, and would impress
itself indelibly on an eye such as Holbein's.
In more than one cathedral, too, as he wandered
in such a holiday, he would have noted
how Mantegna had made its architecture the
background for his own individual genius.</p>

<p>At any rate each of these, somehow and
somewhere, set its own seal upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
reverent heart of Holbein at about this time.
Whether through their original works or
copies of them,&mdash;already familiar to Augsburg
as well as Lucerne,&mdash;the lad sat humbly at
the feet of both Leonardo and Mantegna. By
the first, beside many a loftier lesson, he was
confirmed and strengthened in his native respect
for accurate studies of the living world around
him. From the second he learned a still deeper
scorn of "pretty" art. Yet though he sat
at their feet, it was as no servile disciple. He
would fain be taught by them; fain follow
them in all humility and frankness. But it
was in order to expand his own powers, not
to surrender them; to speak his own thoughts
the better, not theirs, nor another's.</p>

<p>And, in any event, on such a journey
Lucerne must come first. And that he thought
of making some long stay here when he returned
is shown by his having joined in this year
1517, the Guild of St. Luke, the Painters'
Guild of Lucerne, then but newly organised.
"Master Hans Holbein has given one Gulden,"
reads the old entry. Two other items of this
visit give us glimpses of its flesh-and-blood
realities, perhaps of its unrest. The first,
that he also joined a local company of Archers,
the Militia of his day, seems to bring his living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
footfall very close. A resonant, manly, wholesome
footfall it is, too! This broad-shouldered
young fellow is as ready to draw a good stout
bow among mountain-marksmen as a lamb
among its daffodils. The second item makes
it still clearer that he had other elements as
well as the pastoral in his blood. On the 10th
of December he got himself fined for his share
in a street-scrimmage, where he would seem
to have decidedly preferred the livelier to the
"better part" of valour.</p>

<p>And then he would appear to have shaken
the dust, or more likely the snows, of Lucerne
off his feet for the road to Italy, if not for
Italy itself. Whatever his objective, he got,
at any rate, well on toward the Pass of
the St. Gothard. The scanty clues of such
works as have remained on record prove that
he reached Altdorf. But there the actual trail
is altogether lost. If he spent the entire interval
brush in hand, or if&mdash;as I believe&mdash;he
treated himself to a bit of a holiday beyond
the Alps, can be but a guess in the dark.</p>

<p>By this time the New Year of 1518, then falling
in March, could not have been far off, before
or behind him. And in 1518 Holbein executed
the commission which must have been the envy
of every local artist. Jacob von Hertenstein,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Burgomaster of Lucerne, had now got his
fine new house ready for decoration; and it
was to Holbein that he gave the splendid
commission to decorate it to his fancy,&mdash;the
interior as well as the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

<p>And a renowned triumph the painter made
of it; a triumph such as, perhaps, no other
artist north of Italy could then have equalled.
It is idle now to dwell upon the religious
subjects of one room, the genre paintings in
another, the battle scenes of a third, and so
on through those five famous rooms which
were still in existence and fair preservation
so late as 1824, but are now for ever lost;
to say nothing of the painted Renaissance
architecture and the historic legends which
looked like solid realities when the fa&ccedil;ade was
studied. But "Mizraim is become merchandise";
and all that is now left of what
should have been a treasured and priceless
heirloom is but a monument to the shame of
that citizen, a banker, who could condemn
such a thing to destruction as indifferently as
if it had been a cowshed, and to the shame
of the municipality which, at any cost, did
not prevent it. Some hasty sketches&mdash;due to
individual enterprise and a sense of the dignity
of Holbein's fame&mdash;an original drawing for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
one of the fa&ccedil;ade-paintings, and a few fragments
of the interior paintings, which still show
themselves, by chance, in the banker's <i>stable
wall</i>&mdash;these are all that remain to speak of
what must have been the enthusiastic labour
of the greater part of Holbein's twenty-first
year!</p>

<p>And now it is 1519, and with it the true
Hour of Holbein's destiny is striking.
Take away the coming seven years and you
will still have what Holbein is too often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
thought to be only&mdash;a great portrait-painter.
No greater ever etched the soul of a man on
his mask. His previous and his after achievements
would still amply justify the honour of
centuries. But add these seven years, from
1519 to 1526, and dull indeed must be the
intelligence that cannot recognise the great
Master, without qualification and in the light
of any thoughtful comparison with the very
greatest.</p>

<p>His Basel career may be said to begin here;
his earlier work furnishing the Prologue. On
the 25th September, 1519, when he was about
two-and-twenty, he joined the Basel Guild of
Painters; that same "Guild of Heaven" (<i>Zunft
zum Himmel</i>) which his brother Ambrose had
joined two years earlier and from which he
seems to have passed to the veritable guild of
Heaven at about this latter date.</p>

<p>And hardly is the ink dry upon the record
of his membership than Holbein painted one of
the most beautiful of his portraits&mdash;that of
Bonifacius Amerbach (<a href="#hpl6">Plate 6</a>). He stands
beside a tree on which is hung an inscription.
Behind him is Holbein's favourite early background,&mdash;the
blue of the sky, here broken by the
warm brown and green of the branch, and the
faint glimpse of far-away mountains. Under his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
soft cap, with a cross for badge, his intensely
gleaming blue eyes look out beneath grave
brows. The lips are softly yet firmly set; the
mouth framed by the sunny beard which repeats
the red-brown of his hair. The black
scholar's gown, with its trimming of black fur,
discloses his rich damask doublet and white
collar.<a name="himg6" id="himg6"></a><a name="hpl6" id="hpl6"></a></p>

<p>Well may the inscription assert&mdash;above the
signature, the name of the sitter and the date
14th October, 1519&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="noindent">
<i>"Though but a painted face I am not far removed from Life; but rather,<br />
By truthful lines, the noble image of my Possessor.<br />
As he accomplishes eight times three years, so faithfully in me also<br />
Is Nature's work proclaimed by the work of Art."</i><br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">For here in truth is a work of Nature which is
no less a work of Art.</p>

<p>This is the Amerbach who began and inspired
his son Basilius (so named after Bonifacius's
brother) to complete the Holbein
Collection, which the Basel Museum bought
long afterwards. And such was the love of
both that they included, perhaps deliberately,
much that has small probability of claim to
be Holbein's work. They would reject nothing
attributed to him; thinking a bushel of chaff<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
well worth housing if it might yield one
genuine grain. And in view of these expressive
facts, it is hardly necessary to argue in
behalf of the tradition that more than a conventional
friendship bound the two young men
together,&mdash;printer's son and painter's son,
musician-scholar and scholar-painter, Churchman
and Churchman; the one twenty-four, the
other twenty-two.</p>

<p>Bonifacius was the youngest of Johann
Amerbach's three gifted sons. As all the
world knows, Johann had been also a scholar
as well as a printer, and great in both capacities.
The most eminent scholars of his day
gravitated as naturally to this noble personality
as they afterwards did to that of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;
and successor, Johann Froben. He had educated
his sons, too, to worthily continue his
life-work and maintain his devout principles.
Bonifacius was the darling of more than one
heart not given to softness. He had been
more the friend than the pupil of Ulrich Zasius
at the University of Freiburg, before he went
to Avignon to complete his legal studies under
Alciat. Five years after this portrait was
painted he became Professor of Law in the
Basel University. "I am ready to die," writes
Erasmus of him, "when I shall have seen any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
young man purer or kinder or more sincere
than this one."</p>

<p>Very possibly it was for Bonifacius himself
that Holbein painted his own portrait about
this time (<a href="#hpl1">Plate 1</a>, frontispiece). It is a worthy
mate, at all events. In the Amerbach Catalogue
it was simply called "Holbein's counterfeit,
in dry colour" (<i>ein conterfehung Holbein's
mit trocken farben</i>); the frame, too, was catalogued,
though the painting was kept in a
cabinet separately when the Basel Museum
acquired it with the Collection.</p>

<p>The vigour and finish of this portrait on
vellum, done in crayons or body-colour, make
it a gem of the first water. The drawing was
done in black chalk, and the tints have been
rubbed in with coloured crayons or given with
the point where lines of colour were required.
The work has the delicacy of a water-colour
and the strength of oils. The broad, soft, red
hat, though so fine a bit of colour, is clearly
worn as part of a simple everyday habit.
There is no suggestion of studying for effect,
or even caring at all about it. He wears his
hat pulled soberly down over his brown hair
exactly as when he wore it thus about the
business of the day. The plastic modelling of
the puckered brow and the mobile mouth is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
beautifully indicated. The bluish tone left by
the razor is just hinted. In his drab coat with
its black velvet bands, with his shirt, on which
the high lights have been applied, slightly open
at the throat, Holbein himself seems to stand
before one as in life.</p>

<p>Among the "early works" of the Amerbach
Catalogue there is one which shows strong
traces of Leonardo's and even more of Mantegna's
influence on him at this time. It is
a Last Supper, painted in oils on wood. But
it was so mutilated in the iconoclastic fury
of 1529, and has been so cobbled, re-broken,
re-set, and "restored" generally, that it can
no longer be called Holbein's work without
many reservations. There is also another
Last Supper, one of a coarsely painted set on
canvas, which is attributed to him on much
more doubtful grounds, to judge by the composition
and colouring. Myself I should be inclined
to see the inferior hand of Ambrose,
Hans the elder, or perhaps even Sigmund
Holbein in these, if they are genuine Holbein
works at all.</p>

<p>But there are still to be seen the traces of
his own hand and mind in the Last Supper
in oils on wood. St. John's head must originally
have been very beautiful; very manly,
too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>&mdash;dark
with sudden anguish and recoil. There
is a separate head of St. John, in oils, in the
same collection, which shows how fixed was
this noble originality of type in Holbein's conception
of "the beloved apostle." But it is in
Judas that the patient student will find, perhaps,
most of Holbein's peculiar cast of thought,
when once the initial repulsion is overcome.</p>

<p>By a very natural arrangement he is brought
into the immediate foreground and sits there,
already isolated, already damned, in such a
torment of body and soul as haunts the spectator
who has had the courage to reconsider
the dictum of authorities who call him "a Jew
of frightful vulgarity." Frightful he may be;
but it is a strange judgment which can find
him vulgar. Unfortunately, the painting is no
longer in a condition to justify reproduction;
but such as study this yellow-robed, emaciated,
shivering, fever-consumed Judas will, I venture
to assert, find food for thought in it even under
all the injuries the work has undergone.</p>

<p>It is a demon-driven soul if ever there was
one. He is in the very act of springing to his
feet and rushing away anywhere, anywhere
out of this Presence;&mdash;no more concerned about
his money-bag than about the food he loathes.
Thirty pieces of silver! If the priests have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
lied, if this is in very truth the Messiah his
heart still half believes Him, will thirty pieces
of silver buy his soul from the Avenger? Is
there time still to escape? What if he break
the promise given when he was over-persuaded
in the market-place the other day? But did
not the High Priest himself declare that this is
Beelzebub in person,&mdash;this fair, false, dear,&mdash;oh!
still too dear Illusion? Up! Let him
be gone out of this!&mdash;from the sound of that
Voice, from the sight of that Face, get the
thing over and done, done&mdash;done one way or
another! If God's work, as the priests swear,
well and good. He will have earned the pity
of God Himself. If the devil's, as his heart
whispers, well, too! Let him take his price
and buy himself a rope long enough to house
his soul in any Hell, rather than sit on in this
one! It is all painted, or was once; all
written on that sunken cheek, that matted
hair and clammy brow; in that cavernous
socket, that eye of lurid despair; on the whole
anatomy of a lost soul. The hand that did it
was very young, very immature; but it had
the youth and the immaturity of a Master.</p>

<p>There is another and a very different work, an
oil painting, in the Royal Collection at Lisbon,
signed <span class="small">IOANNES HOLBEIN FECIT 1519</span>, which, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
by the younger Hans, would almost put the
question as to whether the painter knew the
landscapes of Italy, beyond doubt; so southern
is the type of its background. The work, however,
has been rejected by Woltmann, on the
strength of an old photograph not quite perfect.
He held the signature to be spurious, and attributed
the picture to the school of Gerard David.
And he gave to the work the name by which it
is now generally styled in English works: "The
Fountain of Life" (<i>Der Brunnen des Lebens</i>).<a href="#fn3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a><a name="fm3r" id="fn3r"></a>
He did so from the inscription within the rim
of the well immediately in the foreground; but
a literal translation of this inscription, <span class="small">PVTEVS
AQUARUM VIVENCIUM</span>, is, I think, to be preferred:
<i>The Well of Living Waters</i>.</p>

<p>The majority of those competent to form a
judgment in such matters are inclined to attribute
the work to Hans Holbein the Elder, who
did not die until some years later, and who
made use of a very similar form of signature.
And for myself I find it hard to see how anyone
familiar with Hans the Younger could accept
it as his work at any period of his career; least<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
of all at the date given in the signature. So
that equally whether Woltmann is right in
believing the signature itself spurious, or those
are right who hold it to be the genuine signature
of Hans the Elder,&mdash;a more detailed description
of the composition does not fall within
the scope of this little volume. But the whole
matter is most clearly set forth, and a very
beautiful reproduction in colours given of the
painting itself, in Herr Seeman's article upon
it, which will be found in the appended List
of References.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Considerably before 1519, as has been said,
Holbein had begun to develop his special
genius for Design, and to apply it to glass or
window-paintings, as well as to metal and
wood-engravings. The beautiful drawings,
whether washed, or etched with the point, in
chalks or Indian ink, of which examples may
be seen in almost every great collection,
private as well as public, that year after year
were created by that fertile brain and ever
more masterly hand, constitute an Art in themselves.
And since so many (perhaps the
greater number as well as the greater in
subject) of his paintings have perished, it is
chiefly in his drawings that the progression of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
his powers can be followed, or the plane and
scope of his imagination recognised at all.
There is seldom a date on them; but they will
be found to date themselves pretty accurately
by certain features. In his earliest, for instance,
that defect of which mention has been made,&mdash;the
short thick figures due to the energy of
his rebound from Gothic attenuation is a grave
fault. There is a Virgin and Child among his
washed drawings for glass-paintings in the
Basel Museum, for example, which, when you
cut it off at the knees, is one of the most
charming pictures of Mother and Child to be
found in any painter's treatment of this subject.
And behind them is a gem of landscape. Yet
the whole, as it stands, is utterly marred by the
Virgin's dwarfed limbs. But although Holbein
never entirely overcame this fault, he did very
greatly do so, as the years passed.</p>

<p>His architectural settings, too, tended to
greater simplicity in his later years. Yet this
is not a safe guide. Some early designs have
simple forms; some comparatively late ones,
a very ornate architecture. For the truth is
that these architectural backgrounds and settings
remained, so long as his fancy had any
free field for disporting itself, an integral
part of his conception. But only as inseparable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
from the Symbolism, the under-tow, of his imagination.
To my thinking, at any rate, they
make a gravid mistake who look for "realism"
in these things.</p>

<p>His stately pillars and arches, his fluid forms
of ornament, are not his idea of the actual
surroundings of the characters he portrays,
any more than they are your idea, or mine,
of those surroundings. Is it to be supposed
that he thought the dwellings of our Lord
were palaces? Or that he could not paint a
stable? Those who maintain that Holbein was
a Realist in the modern sense of the word
must reconcile as best they can the theory
with the facts. But when we see the stage
set with every stately circumstance,&mdash;the Babe
amid the fading splendours of earthly palaces,
our Lord mocked by matter as well as man,&mdash;I
dare to think that we shall do well to cease
from insisting on an adobe wall, and to study
those "incongruous" circumstances to which
the will and not the poverty of Holbein consents.
We shall, at least, no longer be dull
to "the tears of things" as he saw them.</p>

<p>But it would be no less a mistake to think
of Holbein as one without a sense of laughter
as well. His drawings of open-mouthed peasants
gossiping in a summer's nooning, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
dancing in some uncouth frolic,&mdash;and still more
his romping children, dancing children, and
the chase of the fox running off with the goose,&mdash;all
of these are full of boyish fun. Would
that they could be given here without usurping
the place of more important works! But that
is impossible. And so, too, with the costume-figures
of Basel, among which is the charming
back view of a citizen's wife, with all the
women bent far backward in the odd carriage
that was then "the latest fashion" among
them.</p>

<p>He was particularly happy, also, in his drawings
of the <i>Landsknechte</i>, those famous Mercenaries
of "Blut und Eisen"; always ready
to drink a good glass, and a-many; to love
a good lass after the same liberal fashion; to
troll a good song or fight a good fight; and
all with equal zest. He had not mixed with
these masterful gentry for nothing; nor they
with him to wholly die. There are a number
of drawings where they are engaged in combat,
too, which show that Holbein's heart leapt
to the music of sword and spear as blithely
as does Scott's or Dumas's&mdash;as blithely as did
the hearts of the <i>Reisl&auml;ufer</i> themselves. Look
at the mad rush, the hand-to-hand grapple,
in a drawing of the Basel Collection, for instance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
(<a href="#hpl7">Plate 7</a>). The blood-lust, the heroism,
the savagery, the thrust, the oath, the dust-choked
prayer, the forgotten breathing clay
under the bloodstained foot; the very clash and
din of the fray;&mdash;all is told with the brush.
And yet not one unnecessary detail squandered.
It is as if one watched it from some palpitating
refuge, just near enough to see the forefront
figures distinctly and to make out the interlocked
hubbub and fury where the ranks have
been broken through. It would be a great
day for Art could we but chance upon some
lost painting for which such a study had served
its completed purpose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the 3rd of July, 1520, Holbein fulfilled
what was then the requirement of almost every
guild, and purchased his citizenship; a citizenship
to reflect unfading honour on Basel, and
of which she has ever been justly proud. And
somewhere about the same time he married
Elsbeth Schmidt, a tanner's widow, who had
one child, Franz.<a name="himg7" id="himg7"></a><a name="hpl7" id="hpl7"></a></p>

<p>For the past four or five years Basel had
been steadily becoming more and more democratic.
And at a period when its <i>&eacute;lite</i> were
scholars and printers and civic officials of every
origin,&mdash;when the illegitimate son of a Rotterdam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
doctor was the true prince, and Beatus
Rhenanus, the grandson of a butcher, was his
worthy second in the reverence of Basel,&mdash;the
widow and son of a reputable tanner and a
rising young artist, who had already the suffrages
of the most influential citizens, would
find no doors closed to them on the score of
social disabilities. The friendship of such men
as Erasmus, Froben, Bonifacius Amerbach,
and the Mayor,&mdash;all conspicuous stars in the
Church party,&mdash;would have ennobled a man of
less genius than Holbein in the eyes of his
fellow-citizens; and rightly. But as to the
exact locality in which Holbein set up his first
married roof-tree&mdash;that Bethel of sacred or
saddest dreams&mdash;no documentary evidence has
yet come to light. Circumstantial evidence,
however, amounts to a strong probability in
favour of the <i>Rheinhalde</i> of Great-Basel.</p>

<p>If there was an emblem peculiarly abhorrent
to the Basilisk (the Device of Basel) it was the
Crescent-and-star. But nothing could better
serve to recall the rough outline of Basel in
Holbein's day than this very emblem. As the
Rhine suddenly swerves from its first wild rush
westward and races away, northerly, to the
German Ocean, it shapes the hollow of the
crescent in which Little-Basel (<i>Klein-Basel</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
nestled as the star; and, appropriately enough,
since it was here that the Catholic's Star of
Faith rallied when overcome across the river,
where curved the crescent of Great-Basel
(<i>Gross-Basel</i>). And the relative proportions of
the two would be fairly enough represented by
the symbols respectively used.</p>

<p>Great-Basel's northern face was protected
by the Rhine, while the stout city wall secured
its convex curve. Of this wall the eastern
horn was St. Alban's Gate; its north-west was
St. John's Gate (<i>St. Johann Thor</i>); beside
which stood the decaying Commandery of the
Knights of Malta, which had contributed a
large sum toward the expanded wall, in order
to be included within it. And just as these
spots still mark the horns of the old crescent,
the <i>Spalen Thor</i> shows where it had its greatest
depth, midway between the other two.</p>

<p>A straight line running due north-east from
this Spalen-Thor would cross the big square
of the Fish-market (<i>Fischmarktplatz</i>) pretty
nearly as the uncovered stream of the Birsig,
or "Little Birs," did before the quaint little
bridge, which then united the two halves of the
Fischmarkt, was absorbed in the paving over
of stream and square before Holbein's day.
This same straight line would of itself draw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
the "Old Bridge" (<i>Alte Br&uuml;cke</i>) with approximate
exactness, the even then ancient bridge
which centred the star of Klein-Basel to its
crescent. And in the Historical Museum,
where the Barefooted Friars worshipped then,
we may still see the grotesque piece of clockwork,
the wooden "Stammering King" (<i>L&auml;llenk&ouml;nig</i>),
that for centuries used hourly to roll
great eyes and stick out its tongue a foot long
across the river from the Gross-Basel end of
the bridge. It is often said that this monster
was set up as a public token of the hatred
which the triumphant Protestantism of the
south bank felt for the stubborn Catholicism of
Klein-Basel. But the thing was a famous
ancient joke before party feeling turned it into
a gibe.</p>

<p>Bonifacius Amerbach's home, the "Emperor's
Seat" (<i>Kaiserstuhl</i>, now 23, Rheingasse),
was in Klein-Basel. Johann Amerbach
had bought it, near to his beloved friends, the
Carthusians. In 1520 the good old man had
slept for six years in the cloisters of the
monastery; where to-day the children of the
Orphan Asylum play above his grave.</p>

<p>But all the conditions of Holbein's daily life
would lead him to prefer Basel proper, and to
choose the quarter in which he bought a home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
eight years later. This was then the western
quarter of Gross-Basel, along the river-face of
which ran the high southern and western bank
of the Rhine, the <i>Rheinhalde</i>, now <i>St. Johann
Vorstadt</i>. About where the present <i>Blumenrain</i>
ends stood the arch, or <i>Schwibbogen</i>.
Further on still stood the "Gate of the Cross"
(<i>Kreuzthor</i>), by the House of the Brothers of
St. Anthony, the ancient <i>Kl&ouml;sterli</i> of Basel.
Before the Commandery of St. John got themselves
included within the city wall the Kreuzthor
was its western gate. The whole district
of <i>ze Cr&uuml;ze</i>, so called because its boundaries
were crosses before towers replaced them, has
however become absorbed in the St. Johann
Vorstadt, while the Kreuzthor has disappeared
altogether. The quarter was a favourite one
with members of the Fishers' Guild and with
decent folk of small means.</p>

<p>As early as 1517 the Fishers' Company had
extended itself so greatly as to become a
notable institution of the Vorstadt, including
many members from Klein-Basel also; while
its military record was a proud one. But it
was in this year, while Holbein was making
his visit to Lucerne and beyond, that this guild
took the more truly descriptive name which
it bears to this day, that of the "Vorstadt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Association" (<i>Vorstadtgesellschaft</i>). And to
this association, which in after years gave him
a famous banquet, Holbein, we know, belonged
later on, if not now.</p>

<p>Every day would take him to the Fischmarkt,&mdash;the
great square humming with activity,
crowded with inns, public-houses, shops,
booths, dwelling-houses,&mdash;the trade mart of
every nationality. The Cornmarkt near by,
now the <i>Marktplatz</i>, with its almost finished
Rathaus, was the centre of official civic life.
When the great bell clanged on the Rathaus,
and its flag was flung out, not only every
professional soldier, but every guild and every
male above fourteen, knew his appointed place
at the wall, and took it. But every day, and
all day, the Fischmarkt flung out its peaceful
standards, or rallied men to this side or to that
with the tocsin of its presses,&mdash;the old Amerbach
printing-house "of the Settle" (<i>zum Sessel</i>),
which was Johann Froben's home and printing-house
in 1520.</p>

<p>Morning after morning, and year upon year,
Holbein turned his back upon St. Johannthor,
and walked eastward along the Rheinhalde;&mdash;the
river racing toward him on his left hand,
the University rising in front of him beyond
the bridge, and the delicate Cathedral towers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
beyond the University. For the Basel Minster
was still the Cathedral of the great See of
Basel. Passing the wall of the Dominican
Cemetery, on which was painted the ancient
Dance of Death with which his own after-creations
were so often to be confused, Holbein
must many a time have studied the famous old
copy. For though the Dominican painting
was then nearly a century old, it was a copy
of a still older original in the Klein-Basel
nunnery of <i>Klingenthal</i>, a community under
Dominican direction.</p>

<p>But he would pass another spot&mdash;one day
to be of far more living importance to him.
In 1520 it was a corn warehouse, known by
the name of <i>ze Cr&uuml;z</i>, which belonged to Adam
Petri, the printer, who had inherited it from
his uncle, the famous printer Johann Petri,
by whose ingenious improvements the art of
printing was so greatly facilitated. Two years
later, in 1522, Froben bought this granary,
ze Cr&uuml;z, and converted it into the book-magazine
which was known all over Europe
as "Froben's Book-house." And in this
latter year Adam Petri, greatly to Luther's
disgust, pirated Luther's translation of the
New Testament, which had appeared three
months before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Holbein drew a superb title-page, ante-dated
1523, for this "enterprise" of Petri&mdash;the New
Testament "now right faithfully rendered into
German,"&mdash;with the symbols of the Evangelists
at the four corners, the arms of Basel at the
top, the device of the printer at the foot, and
the noble figures of St. Paul and St. Peter
on either side; figures which will bear comparison
with D&uuml;rer's "Four Temperaments"
of a later date. Later still he designed another
striking title-page for Thomas Wolff's translation;
and his beautiful title-pages and ornaments
for Froben, with whom his connection
was not a temporary matter such as these
others, would need a volume to themselves.</p>

<p>Holbein's only rival, if he could be called such,
in work of this sort was the talented goldsmith,
Urs Graf, who, as an exceedingly loose fish, lived
most appropriately in the Fischmarkt in his own
house near the old Birsig Bridge, when he was
not in the lock-up for one or another of his
constant brawls and scandals. But to compare
the best work of both is to recognise a difference
in kind as well as degree: the essential
difference between even negligent genius and
the most elaborate talent. High talent Urs
Graf had unquestionably; though stamped,&mdash;I
think,&mdash;with the lawless caprices of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
character. Holbein's every design has not
only what Urs Graf lacked&mdash;that ordered imagination
which is Style&mdash;but over and above
all, the subtle expression of Power.</p>

<p>Many a time, too, just where he would turn
away from the Rhine for the business centre of
Gross-Basel, the artist would make some little
pause at the old "Flower" Inn (<i>zur Blume</i>),
which gave its name to the Blumenplatz, and
is still commemorated in the greatly extended
Blumenrain of to-day. All the world now knows
the famous hotel of "The Three Kings";
and where it reaches nearest to the Old Bridge
stood the "Blume" of Holbein's time, even then
the oldest of the Basel inns. This Blume, not
to be confused with later inns of the same
name, shared with its no less famous contemporary,&mdash;"The
Stork," in the Fischmarkt,&mdash;the
special patronage of the chief printers. Basilius
Amerbach, for instance, the brother of Holbein's
friend Bonifacius, lived at the Blume;
and often the painter must have turned in for
a friendly glass with him and a chat about
Bonifacius, away at his law studies in Avignon.</p>

<p>As for the Stork, its very rooms were named
in remembrance of the envoys and merchant
traders who flocked to it on all great occasions.
There was a "Cologne Room," for instance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and a "Venetian Room," among many others.
The men of Venice, indeed, had a particular
affection for it. Here Holbein met with all
nationalities, and learned much of the great
centres of other countries. Here came all the
Basel magnates and printers. And here, a few
years later on, came that bizarre personage
who was for a very brief time Basel's "town
physician," the Paracelsus Theophrastus Bombastus
to whom we owe our word <i>bombastic</i>.
Holbein was on a visit to England during the
latter's short tenure of office, when the combined
scholarship and poverty of Oporinus
made him the hack of Paracelsus and the
victim of many a petty tyranny. At that time
Oporinus,&mdash;the son of that Hans Herbster,
painter, whose portrait is now attributed to
Ambrose Holbein,&mdash;was glad to place his remarkable
knowledge of Greek at Froben's
service. He was not yet a printer, as later
when Holbein drew a clever device for him.
And neither he nor the painter could know that
one day the daughter of Bonifacius Amerbach
should marry him out of sheer pity for his
unhappy old age,&mdash;somewhat as he himself,
when but a lad of twenty, married an aged
Xantippe from gratitude.</p>

<p>But in 1520, when Holbein was just married,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Oporinus was still a student and Bonifacius
unmarried. Erasmus, too, did not permanently
take up his home with Froben until the
following year, and was now at Louvain. Yet
what a true university was that little house
<i>zum Sessel</i> (now 3, Todteng&auml;sslein, the little
lane where the old post-office stood) to an
intelligence such as Holbein's! And what a
circle was that of Froben's staff! From Froben
himself, above whom Erasmus alone could
tower in scholarship, down through every
member to the youngest, and from such men
as Gerard Lystrius on the one hand and the
literally "Beatus" Rhenanus on the other,
what things were not to be learned!</p>

<p>And what discussions those were that drew
each man to give of his best in the common
talk! Venice sent news of the "unspeakable"
Turk, whom she had such good cause to watch
and dread. For fifty years his name had ceased
to blanch the cheek of other nations; but now
it was said, and said truly, that the dying
Selim, "the Grim," had forged a thunderbolt
which Suleyman II. would not be slow to hurl.
No man could know the worst or dared predict
the end, as to that Yellow Terror of Holbein's
time. And closer still, to keen eyes, were the
threats of the coming Peasant Terror. Wurtemberg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
had battened down the flames, it is
true; but the deck of Europe was hot under
foot with the passions that were soon to make
the Turks' atrocities seem gentle in comparison.</p>

<p>The death of Maximilian and the election of
Charles V. were a year old now. But none
knew better than the Basel printers how much
the League of Swabia and the Swiss Confederation
had weighed in the close contest of claims
between those three strangely youthful competitors
for the Emperor's crown;&mdash;Charles,
but nineteen; Francis I., one-and-twenty; and
Henry VIII., not twenty-five. Basel also knew
that Charles had only bought his triumph by
swearing to summon the Diet of Worms. All
the more, therefore, was she intensely alive
to the possible issues of the Arabian-Nights-Entertainment
which had but just concluded on
the dreary Calais flats when Holbein became
one of Basel's citizens. Erasmus had come
back full of it. Marco Polo's best wonders
made but a dingy show beside the "Field of
the Cloth of Gold," where in this June the two
defeated candidates for imperial honours had
kissed each other midway between the ruined
moat of Guisnes and the rased battlements of
Arde.</p>

<p>Then, on top of this, came the rumours of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
English King's undertaking to answer Luther's
most formidable attack on Rome. It was
in 1520, the year after his great disputation
with Eck at Leipzig, that Luther published
his cataclysmic addresses: "To the Christian
Nobles of Germany" and "On the Babylonian
Captivity,"&mdash;the latter of which itself contains
the whole Protestant Reformation in embryo.
"Would to God," exclaimed Erasmus of it,
"that he had followed my counsel and abstained
from odious and seditious proceedings!"
Bishop Tunstall, then in Worms, had
also written of it:&mdash;"I pray God keep that book
out of England!" But before the year was
out "that book" had reached England, and
Henry VIII. had sworn to annihilate its arguments
and to triumphantly defend the dogmas
of Rome. The eagerly-awaited "Defence"
did not get printed, and <ins title="lacking in original">would remain</ins> in Pope Leo's hands
for a year yet. But Basel knew, through More
and Erasmus,&mdash;whose canny smile probably
discounted its critical quality,&mdash;pretty much its
line of defence. Nor was Froben's circle one
whit more surprised than its royal author when
its immediate reward was that formal style and
title&mdash;<i>Defender of the Faith</i>,&mdash;to which a few
years more were to lend so different a
significance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>By this latter date Ulrich von Hutten had
fled to Basel, only to find that his violent
"heresies" had completely estranged Erasmus,
and closed Froben's door, as well as all other
Roman Catholic doors, against him for ever.
He lodged, therefore, at the Blume until the
Basel Council requested him to leave the town,
a little before his death, in 1523. But in 1520
Hutten was still at Sickingen's fortress,
digging with fierce ardour the impassable
gulf between him and the band of friends and
Churchmen among whom Holbein ever ranged
himself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the five lost works which Patin says
Holbein painted, there was a "Nativity" and
an "Adoration of the Kings." It is impossible
now to say what resemblances, if any, existed
between these and the same subjects, executed
not much later, which are now in the University
Chapel, Freiburg Minster. These latter are
the only known works of Holbein that still
hang in a sacred edifice. They were evidently
designed to fold in upon a central altar-piece
with an arched top, thus making, when open,
the usual triptych; but the central painting
has vanished. This large work was a gift
to the Carthusian monastery in Klein-Basel;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and the arms of the donor, Hans Oberriedt, are
displayed below the Nativity, as well as the
portraits of himself and his six sons. Below
the corresponding right wing, the Adoration,
are the arms of his wife and her portrait, with
her four daughters.</p>

<p>In both wings what I can only describe as
the atmosphere of Infancy,&mdash;and a touching
atmosphere it is too&mdash;is strengthened by
keeping all the figures small and heightening
this suggestion by contrast with a grandiose
architecture. In both, too, the sacred scenes
reveal themselves like visions unseen by the
Oberriedt family, who face outward toward
the altar and are supposed to be lighted by
the actual lights of the church. The whole
work must once have been a glorious creation,
with its rich colours, its beautiful architectural
forms, and its mingling of purest imagination
with realism. What would one not give to see
the lost work these wings covered?</p>

<p>In the left wing, the Nativity (<a href="#hpl8">Plate 8</a>), Holbein
has remarkably anticipated the lighting of
Correggio's famous masterpiece, not finished
until years after this must have been painted, by
the conditions of Oberriedt's history and Basel's
as well. The Light that is to light the world
lights up the scene with an exquisite enchanting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
softness,&mdash;yet so brilliantly that the very
lights of heaven seem dimmed in comparison.
The moon, in Holbein's deliberate audacity,
seems but a disc as she bows her face, too,
in worship. Shining by some compulsion of
purest Nature, the divine radiance glows on
the ecstatic Mother; and away above and
beyond her&mdash;"How far that little candle
shines," and shines, and shines again amid
the shadows! It illumines the beautiful face
of the Virgin, touches the reverent awe of
St. Joseph, plays over marble arch and pillar,
discovers the wondering shepherd peering from
behind the pillar on the left, and irradiates the
angel in the distance, hastening to carry the
"glad tidings." The happy cherubs behind
the Child rejoice in it; and as they spring
forward one notices how Holbein has boldly
discarded the conventional, and attached their
pinions as if these were a natural development
of the arm instead of a separate member.<a name="himg8" id="himg8"></a><a name="hpl8" id="hpl8"></a></p>

<p>The same union of unfettered fancy symbolism
and realism displays itself throughout
the right wing,&mdash;where the Virgin is enthroned
in front of crumbling palaces. The sun's rays
form a great star, of such dazzling light that
one of the attendants shades his eyes to look
upward, and an old man with a noble head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
wearing an ermine cape, presents his offering
as the chief of the three kings; while a Moorish
sovereign, dressed in white, makes a splendid
figure as he waits to kneel with his gift, and
his greyhound stands beside him. The colouring
of both paintings must have had an extraordinary
beauty when the painter laid down his
brush.</p>

<p>To carp at such conceptions because their
architecture is as imaginative and as deeply
symbolical as the action, is to demand that
Holbein shall be someone else. These pictures,
beyond the portraits below them, are the
farthest possible from aiming at what we demand
of Realism, though their own realism
is astonishing. Holbein all too seldom sounds
them, but when he does choose to stir only
a joyous elation in the heart he rings a peal
of silver bells. Here all is glad thanksgiving.
The Divine has come into a sick and sorry
world; and, behold, all is changed! Nothing
sordid, nothing shabby, consists with the <i>meaning</i>
of this miracle. Therefore it is not here.
All is transformed; all is a New Jerusalem&mdash;splendour,
peace, ineffable and mysterious
Beauty.</p>

<p>With the dominance of the anti-Catholic
party, which unseated Meyer zum Hasen in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
1521, his friend Oberriedt also fell into trouble.
And soon after Erasmus and Bonifacius Amerbach,&mdash;disgusted
with the iconoclast fanaticism
of 1528 and 1529,&mdash;took refuge in Catholic
Freiburg-in-the-Breisgau, Oberriedt also left
Basel for that city. He took these wings with
him to save them from the destruction which
probably overtook the central work. The latter
was, perhaps, too large to conceal or get away.
During the Thirty Years' War they were again
removed, and safeguarded at Schaffhausen.
And so great was their fame that they were
twice expressly commanded to be brought
before a sovereign; once to Munich, to be
seen by Maximilian of Bavaria; and again
to Ratisbon for the Emperor Ferdinand III.
In 1798 they were looted by the French, and
were only restored to Freiburg in 1808.</p>

<p>Another great religious picture, once no less
renowned than Oberriedt's altar-paintings, has
suffered a worse fate. This is the eight-panelled
altar-piece of the Passion, now in
the Basel Museum (<a href="#hpl9">Plate 9</a>). So far back as
is known it was preserved, probably after
being hidden from the fury that attacked all
church pictures, in the Rathaus. Maximilian
I., of Bavaria, the zealous collector of D&uuml;rer's
works, offered almost any price for this altar-piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
by D&uuml;rer's great contemporary. But
Basel, unlike N&uuml;remberg, was not to be bribed;
and the world-famous painting remained to
draw art-lovers from every country in Europe.
Nor did the most competent judges fail to
envy Basel her jewel, and to eulogise its perfections.
Painters such as Sandrart, looking
at it after it had survived a hundred and
fifty years of vicissitude, could exclaim: "It
is a work in which the utmost that our art
is capable of may be found; yielding the palm
to none, whether of Germany or Italy, and
justly wearing the laurel-wreath among the
works of former times."<a name="himg9" id="himg9"></a><a name="hpl9" id="hpl9"></a></p>

<p>Alas! this laurel, too, has been filched
from Holbein's fame. In 1771 the altar-piece
was consigned to the collection where it now
is; and it was then decided to gild the gold and
paint the lily. The work was subjected to one
of those crude "restorations" which respect
nothing save the frame. And no monarch will
ever again compete for its possession. Red is
over red and blue over blue, doubtless; but
in place of Holbein's rich harmony a jangle of
gaudy conflicting colours now sets one's teeth
on edge. So that only in a photograph can one
even enjoy the composition&mdash;all that is left of
the Master.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
But here it can be seen with what art the
painter has so combined eight separate and
distinct pictures, each a gem, into one, by such
a distribution and balance that the whole is as
integral as a pearl. The scene on the Mount
of Olives, which a great critic once pronounced
worthy to compare with Correggio's work, is
only to be surpassed by the Entombment. And
in every scene&mdash;what freedom, action, verve!
From the first to the last all passes with the
swift step of Calamity, yet all with noble
dignity.</p>

<p>The Basel Museum possesses also a set of
ten washed drawings in Indian ink,&mdash;scenes of
the Passion designed for glass-painting,&mdash;which
must be conned and conned again before one
can "know" Holbein at all in his deepest
moods. They are a great Testament, though
they seem unbearably harsh at a superficial
glance. But put aside your own ideas and
humbly study the ideas of Holbein,&mdash;sure that
they must be well worth the reverence of yours
or mine,&mdash;and little by little you will be made
free of that Underworld where Holbein's true
self has its home; you will pierce its gloom
and find its clue and understand its tongue.
It is a small matter whether you and I find
ourselves in sympathy with that world, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
can never be acclimatised. The great matter,
the only matter, is to understand it; to
see in its skeletons something more than
lively bones, in its graves something besides
Horror.</p>

<p>Without mastering the logical sequence of
these ten drawings,&mdash;where scene by scene the
Divine recedes before our eyes, and the Son of
Man assumes more and more the whole burden
of Sin and Death,&mdash;it is inevitable that the life-size
painting of Christ in the Grave, also in
the Basel Museum (<a href="#hpl10">Plate 10</a>), should seem
just a ghastly and "unpardonable" piece of
realism. Realism of the most ghastly truthfulness,
as to a corpse in the grave, it certainly
is. But although it may be questioned whether
such a picture should ever be painted, no one
who looks through the form to the thought
that shapes it would pronounce even this awful
utterance "unpardonable."</p>

<p>There have been those who could see in this
dead Christ,&mdash;lying rigid in a green sarcophagus
that throws over the waxen flesh the ghastly
threat of that decay which would follow if no
miracle intervened,&mdash;there have been those, I
say, who could see in it only superb technique.
And others see only the negation of all idealism,
if not of all faith.<a name="himg10" id="himg10"></a><a name="hpl10" id="hpl10"></a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>Yet put this painting,&mdash;the acme of technical
beauty as well as of ruthless realism,&mdash;at the
close of the ten Passion drawings, and I
venture to believe that the one coherent conception
that runs through them all will legitimately
find its conclusion here.</p>

<p>Here He lies that surrendered Himself to the
punishment of Sin and the penalty of Death&mdash;for
all men and all time. His pale lips are set
with the superhuman agony of the cry with
which He paid the uttermost farthing of that
bond. Man has died for man, martyrs for
faith; here God has died unto Himself, for us.
There has been no playing at death. All the
pitiless terrors of the grave are here, with Him
who for love of us has chosen to know Mortality
"like at all points" with mortal men.
What He bore for us, shall we shrink from so
much as realising? The great eyes are fixed in
a look whose penetrating, almost liquid sweetness
not even the rigor of the final anguish
could obliterate. Divine devotion,&mdash;devotion
more than mortal,&mdash;still lingers in those sockets.
The heart may well dilate before this sight;
the soul fall on its knees. By each of those
bloodstained steps, by the sting of this death,
we have been paid for. Here, here only,&mdash;as
Holbein saw it,&mdash;is the leverage the heathen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
philosopher vainly sighed for to move the
world; God's leverage, Infinite Love.</p>

<p>This is anything but a theological tangent.
A great artist has bequeathed us his beliefs,&mdash;drawn
and painted in many works, with every
patient, virile, expressive power at his command.
There has been enough and to spare
of shrieks or scoffs. A little humility and a
little study is in place, too. For the rest, let us
not forget that this large painting was made
for some altar; and that many a weeping penitent,
many a devout heart, has been pierced
with its message. On the edge of the stone
coffin, which is tinted a warm green within,
and lit by some opening at the foot, is the
inscription in gold letters: "<span class="smallcaps">Jesus Nazarenus
Rex Jud&aelig;orum</span>." The stigmata are painted
with unsparing truth. The work is dated
1521.</p>

<p>There is in the Hampton Court Gallery a
little painting which has only comparatively
recently been recognised as Holbein's, but
which forms the beautiful and fitting close of
this set of religious pictures. As is the case
with so many of his works, the critics are not
unanimous upon it. But the authorities who
have no doubts as to its being a genuine
Holbein of this period are so weighty that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
I need not argue the point in support of my
own convictions.</p>

<p>In the Hampton Court Catalogue it is styled
"Mary Magdalen at our Lord's Sepulchre,"
but I prefer to call it the Risen Christ (<a href="#hpl11">Plate
11</a>). It must once have been supremely beautiful;
for even now its ideal loveliness shines
through all the evil fortunes which have once
again defaced the handiwork of Holbein. The
type of Christ, and indeed the work throughout,
bears a marked resemblance to the eight-panelled
Basel altar-piece.</p>

<p>The painter has chosen the moment recorded
in the twentieth chapter of St. John. In that
early dawn, "when it was yet dark," Mary
has brought spikenard in a marble cup, if not
to anoint the sacred Dead at least to pour it on
the threshold of the sealed tomb, with tears
and prayers. She has fled to tell St. John and
St. Peter of the sacrilege of the open tomb,&mdash;has
followed them back, still mechanically
clasping her useless spikenard,&mdash;has seen them
go in where her trembling knees refused to
follow, and then go homeward, as we can see
them in the distance, arguing the almost incredible
fact.<a name="himg11" id="img11"></a><a name="hpl11" id="hpl11"></a></p>

<p>Poor Mary has had no heart for discussion.
She has stayed weeping by the empty grave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
until two pitying angels have appeared to
recall her from despair, and she has "turned
herself back,"&mdash;too frightened to stay for comfort.
And then she has seen near her a Face,
a Form, she was too dazed to recognise until
the unforgettable Voice has thrilled through
her, and she has flung herself forward with the
old, instinctive cry, "Master!" to touch, to
clasp that Hand, so dear, so familiar, so all-protecting,
and find it a reality.</p>

<p>It is this tremendous moment that Holbein
has seized. And with what exquisite feeling for
every detail of the scene, every great emotion!
Had the painting been preserved, as it deserved
to be, surely it too could claim a part of that
laurel wreath which Sandrart averred could
not be torn from the Basel altar-piece by any
rival, whether Italian or German.</p>


<p>The misty landscape, with the crosses of
Golgotha and the eastern hills catching the
first brightness of the new Day dawning over
mortality; the broken clouds of night, scattered
like the conquered horrors of the grave,
and the illuminated tomb where Hope and
Faith henceforth ask us why we weep; the
hurrying agitation of St. Peter and the trusting
serenity of St. John, expressed in every gesture;
the dusky trees; Mary's quivering doubt and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
rapture, touched with some new awe; and
the simple majesty with which our Lord stays
that unconscious innocent presumption, <i>Touch
me not</i>.</p>

<p>What forbidding tenderness in that Face
lighted by the grave He has passed through!
What a subtle yet eloquent suggestion of the
eternal difference, henceforth, between Love
and love is in these mortal lineaments that have
evermore resumed their divinity! No face, no
type, no art, can ever realise Christ; yet when
this little painting was first added to the great
roll of Holbein <i>Basiliensis</i>, it must have gone
as near to realising its subject as the colours
of earth can go.</p>

<p>But every man, happily for himself, has a
material as well as an immaterial world with
which he must be concerned. To transpose
Bagehot's profound little saying,&mdash;Each man
dines in a room apart, but we all go down
to dinner together. And though Holbein knew
the pinch of narrow means, he had no lack of
good cheer as well as austere food in his art.</p>

<p>On March 12th, 1521, the Great Council held
its first meeting in the new Rathaus; and Meyer
zum Hasen, who presided over it as Burgomaster,
entrusted to his prot&eacute;g&eacute; the enviable
task of decorating the Council Chamber. Fifty-six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
years after Holbein's work was completed
these wall-paintings were described as "representations
of the noblest subjects&mdash;done by the
German Apelles." By this title the painter was
everywhere recognised throughout the greater
part of his lifetime.</p>

<p>In all, there would seem to have been six
large pictures or set pieces; but two were not
done until years later. One wall being too
broken up by windows to be suitable, there
remained three,&mdash;of which "the back wall" adjoining
Meyer's house was not touched at this
time. Ostensibly the reason was want of funds;
but as a matter of fact the Protestant party (to
anticipate this name), which grew strong enough
to unseat Meyer before the year was out, was
at this time indifferent to art when not positively
inimical to it.</p>

<p>Whether treating a fa&ccedil;ade or an interior it
was Holbein's custom to make a flat wall-space
assume the most solid-looking forms of Renaissance
architecture. Iselin once said of a fa&ccedil;ade
of Holbein's, that there was a dog painted on
it so naturally that the dogs in the street would
run up and bark at it. And so astounding was
the realism with which he threw out balconies,
and added windows, cornices, and statues, and
the richest carvings, pillars, arches, and vistas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of every sort, that no eye could credit them
with illusion. Horses neighed in the courtyards,
flowers bloomed in the gardens, dogs
leaped beside master or mistress, and children
played in the spacious balconies, or moved to
and fro between the splendid marble pillars and
the distant wall. To study the copies that
remain of such works is to be astounded by
their feats of perspective.</p>

<p>Inside would be kindred illusions. Large
pictures would seem to be actually taking place
without, and beheld through beautifully carved
archways or windows; while the apparent walls
would have niches filled with superb marble
statues and the ceiling be supported by pillars,
behind which people walked and talked or
leaned out to watch the chief scenes.</p>

<p>And so it was with the Council Chamber.
But nothing now remains of these works except
fragments and a few drawings for the principal
features. So far as can be judged, each wall
had two large scenes; the four pictures of this
period being chosen from the heroic legends
of the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>; the two painted
later, from the Old Testament.</p>

<p>But while these large works were going
forward Holbein was busy with many others;
private commissions for Froben, occasionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
for other printers, and for altar-pieces or portraits.
All through his life his industry and
accomplishment left him small time for leisure
or the dissipations of leisure. Nor is there any
year of his life when his work does not attest a
clear eye and a firm hand. These things are
their own certificate of conduct; at any rate,
of "worldly" conduct.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1522 occurred two important events in his
life. His first child, the son he called Philip,
was born; and he painted an altar-piece which
is in some respects the most beautiful of his
extant works. The latter&mdash;now in the Solothurn
Museum, and therefore called the "Solothurn
Madonna" (<a href="#hpl12">Plate 12</a>)&mdash;has had one of the
most extraordinary histories to be found in the
records of art.<a name="himg12" id="himg12"></a><a name="hpl12" id="hpl12"></a></p>

<p>The background of this picture,&mdash;a massive
arch of grey sandstone supported by iron stanchions,&mdash;was
evidently designed to suit the
surrounding architecture of some grey-walled
ancient structure. On a da&iuml;s covered with a
green carpet, patterned in white and red and
emblazoned with the arms of the donor and his
wife, sits the lovely Madonna with the Child held
freely yet firmly in two of the most exquisite
hands which even Holbein ever painted. Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
dress is a rich rose-red; her symbolical mantle
of universal Motherhood, or "Grace," is a most
beautiful ultramarine, loaded in the shadows
and like a sapphire in its lights. The flowing
gold of her hair shimmers under its filmy veil,
and the jewels in her gold crown flash below
the great white pearls that tip its points.
Where the sky-background approaches Mother
and Child, its azure tone is lost in a pure effulgence
of light; as if the very ether were
suffused with the sense of the Divine.</p>

<p>The Child is drawn and painted superbly.
The carnations are exquisite; the gravity of
infancy is not exaggerated, yet fittingly enforces
the gesture of benediction. The left hand is
turned outward in a movement so peculiar to
happy, vigorous babyhood that it is a marvel
of observation and nature. The little foot is
admirably foreshortened, and the wrinkled sole
a bit of inimitable painting. But perhaps most
wonderful of all is the art with which, amid so
many splendid details, the Child is the centre
of interest as well as of the picture. How it
is so, is Holbein's own secret.</p>

<p>To right and left of the Virgin stand two
fine types of spiritual and temporal authority.
Behind and at her right, almost hidden by the
amplitude of her mantle, kneels a poor wretch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
who is introduced here by some necessity of the
commission itself, but is skilfully prevented
from obtruding his needs on the serene beauty
of the scene. Dropping gold into his alms-bowl
with a hand effectively contrasted with his
brown thumb, stands "the sinner's saint"&mdash;the
good Bishop of Tours; while some other condition
of the work has embroidered St. Martin's
red mitre with the figure of St. Nicholas. There
is one other striking circumstance about St.
Martin; and that is that, although he is in the
Virgin's presence, he wears the violet chasuble
of an Intercessor. The chasuble is lined with
red, and it and the rich vestments, on which
scenes of the Passion are displayed, are the
patient verisimilitude of ancient vestments. In
St. Martin's gloved left hand is his crozier and
the right glove, which he has drawn off to
bestow his alms.</p>

<p>Opposite to him stands the patron-saint
of Solothurn,&mdash;St. Ursus, a hero of the Theban
legend,&mdash;dressed from head to foot in a suit
of magnificently painted armour. His left
hand grasps his sword-hilt; his right supports
the great red flag with its white cross. Nor is
that flag of the year 1522 the least interesting
detail of this work. With the crimson reflections
of the flag streaking the cold gleams of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
glittering armour, his stern dark face and the
white plumes tossing to his shoulder, St. Ursus
is a figure that may well leave historical
accuracy to pedants. Below his foot are the
initials H.H., and the date, 1522; as if cut
into the stone.</p>

<p>This work was commissioned by Hans
Gerster, for many years Town Archivist of
Basel, in which capacity he had to convey
important state papers to other councils with
which that of Basel had negotiations. From
this it came about that from the year when
Basel entered the Swiss Confederation, in 1501,
Gerster was almost as much at home in the
"City of Ambassadors" as in his own, and the
Dean or <i>Probst</i> of the Solothurn Cathedral&mdash;the
"Cathedral of St. Ursus and St. Victor"&mdash;became
not only his spiritual director, but one
of his most intimate friends. Many circumstances
which cannot be given here make it
pretty evident that in 1522 Gerster, probably
under the advice of the Probst, the Coadjutor
Nicholas von Diesbach, made this picture an
<i>expiatory</i> offering for some secret sin of grave
proportions. There are hints that point to
treachery to the Basel troops, in the Imperial
interests, sympathy with which finally cost him,
as well as his friend Meyer zum Hasen, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
official position. Gerster himself was not a
native of Basel, although his wife, Barbara
Guldenknopf, was.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, it is apparently in direct
connection with this confessed sin that "the
sinner's saint," St. Martin of Tours, is chosen
as Intercessor for Gerster, wearing the prescribed
chasuble for this office. And it seems
likely that the addition to his mitre of the
figure of St. Nicholas was Gerster's wish, in
order to specially associate the name-saint
of his friend&mdash;Nicholas von Diesbach&mdash;with this
intercession. It is assumed by those who have
patiently unearthed these details of circumstantial
evidence, that the beggar is introduced
to mark the identity of the boundlessly charitable
Bishop of Tours. But I venture to suggest
still another reason: this is, that in the uplifted,
pleading face of the mendicant, whose
expression of appeal and humility is a striking
bit of realism in these ideal surroundings, we
may have the actual portrait of the donor, Hans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Gerster himself. That this should be so would
be in strict accord with the methods of the
period. There is a striking parallel which will
occur to all who are familiar with the St.
Elizabeth in the St. Sebastian altar-piece at
Munich. Here the undoubted portrait of Hans
Holbein the elder is seen as the beggar in the
background.</p>

<p>It is, as has been said, a marvellous story by
which this glorious painting,&mdash;in which the introduction
of the patron-saint of Solothurn proves
that it was created for one of her own altars,&mdash;was
completely lost to her, and to the very
histories of Art, and then returned to the city
for which it was originally destined; all by
a chain of seemingly unrelated accidents. But
only the skeleton of that story can be given
here.<a href="#fn4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a><a name="fm4r" id="fn4r"></a></p>

<p>In all probability this Madonna was executed
for the altar of the ancient Lady Chapel of the
Solothurn Cathedral. A hundred and twenty-six
years after it was painted, this chapel was pulled
down, to be replaced by a totally different style
of architecture; and as the picture was then
smoke-stained and "old-fashioned" it would
in all likelihood drop into some lumber-room.
At all events, it must have become the property
of the Cathedral choirmaster,&mdash;one
Hartmann,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>&mdash;after another five-and-thirty years. For at this
time he built, and soon after endowed, the little
village church of Allerheiligen, on the outskirts
of the industrial town of Grenchen, which lies
at the southern foot of the Jura.</p>

<p><i>Facilis descensus!</i> Another turn of the centuries'
wheel and the gift of this chapel's founder
was once again thought unworthy of the altar to
which it had been presented. When Herr Zetter
of Solothurn first saw it in the queer little Allerheiligen
chapel, it hung high up on the choir
wall; blackened, worm-eaten, without a frame,
suspended by a string passed through two holes
which had been bored through the painted panel
itself. Yet his acute eye was greatly interested
by it. And when, during an official visit in
1864, he heard that the chapel was undergoing
a drastic renovation, he was concerned for
the fate of the discoloured old painting. At
first it could not be discovered at all. Finally
he found it, face downward, spotted all over
with whitewash, under the rough boards that
served for the workmen's platform. A few
hours later and it, too, would have been irrevocably
gone; carted away with the "old
rubbish"!</p>

<p>He examined it, made out the signature,
knew that this might mean either any one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
a number of painters who used it, or a clumsy
copy or forgery, yet had the courage of his
conviction that it was Holbein's genuine work.
He bought it of the responsible authority, who
was glad to be rid of four despised paintings,
for the cost of all the new decorations. He
had expert opinion, which utterly discouraged
his belief; but stuck to it, took the risks of
having it three long years (so rotten was its
whole condition) under repairs which might
at any moment collapse with it, yet leave their
tremendous expenses behind to be settled just
the same; and finally found himself the possessor
of a perfectly restored chef-d'&oelig;uvre of
Holbein's brush, which, from the first, Herr
Zetter devoted to the Museum (now a fine new
one) of Solothurn.</p>

<p>To-day this work, which some forty years
ago no one dreamed had ever existed, smiles
in all the beauty of its first painting; a monument
to the insight and generous enthusiasm
of the gentleman whose name is rightly connected
with its own in its official title&mdash;"The
Zetter-Madonna of Solothurn." And it smiles
with Holbein's own undebased handiwork
throughout. <i>Pace</i> Woltmann's blunder,&mdash;its
network of fine cracks, even over the Virgin's
face, attests that it has suffered no over-painting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
The work has been mounted on a solid
back, the greatest fissures and the holes filled
up to match their surroundings, the stains and
defacements of neglect cleared away, and the
triumph is complete. It might well be the
"swan song" of a veteran artist at such work.
Whatever the mistakes of Eigener's career,
the restoration of the Solothurn Madonna was
a flawless achievement for himself and his
associates.</p>

<p>This work, too, is the most precious of all
that have come down to us of Holbein's imaginative
compositions, from the fact that his first-born,
Philip, who was born about 1522, was
the model for the Child, and that a portrait of
Elsbeth, his wife, served as a study for the
Virgin. This portrait is an unnamed and unsigned
drawing in silver-point and Indian ink,
heightened with touches of red chalk, now in
the Louvre Collection. (Plate 13.)<a name="himg13" id="himg13"></a><a name="hpl13" id="hpl13"></a></p>

<p>That this is a portrait of Holbein's wife any
careful comparison with her portrait at Basel
must establish. Feature for feature, allowing
for the changes of sufficient years, the two faces
are one and the same. The very line of the
shoulder, setting of the head, and even the
outline of the fashion in which the low dress is
cut, is alike in both. And equally unmistakable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
is the relation between this Louvre drawing
and the Madonna of Solothurn.</p>

<p>Yet I am unable to accept Woltmann's
theory that the drawing was made in 1522
"for" the Virgin. He assumes that the lettering
which borders the bodice in this drawing&mdash;<span class="small">ALS.
IN. ERN. ALS. IN....</span>&mdash;and the braids in which
the hair is worn are simply some "fancy"
dress. But surely if ever hair bore the stamp
of unstudied, even ugly custom, it does so
here. Then, too, Woltmann himself, as are
all who adopt this explanation, is unable to
reconcile the oldest age which can be assigned
to this sitter with the youngest that can be
assumed for the Basel painting of 1529 upon
a hypothesis of only seven years' interval.
Temperament and trouble can do much in
seven years; but not so much as this. I say
<i>temperament</i> advisedly; because all the evidence
of Holbein's life substantiates the assertion of
Van Mander, who had it from Holbein's own
circle of contemporaries,&mdash;that the painter's
life was made wretched by her violent temper.
We shall find him far from blameless in later
years; but though it may not excuse him, his
unhappy home must largely explain his alienation.</p>

<p>Yet that it can explain such an alteration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
as that between the Louvre drawing and the
Basel portrait I do not believe. Nor could I
persuade myself either that any married woman
of the sixteenth century wore her hair in that
most exclusive and invariable of Teuton symbols&mdash;"maiden"
plaits;&mdash;or that any husband
ever thought it necessary to advertise upon
a picture of his wife that he held her "in all
honour."</p>

<p>Myself, I must believe, then, that this portrait
was made years before 1522; probably in
the young painter's first months in Basel, in
1515; and thus some fourteen years before the
Basel group of 1529 was painted. It may
well have been that some serious misunderstanding
between them was at the bottom of
that otherwise inexplicable departure in 1517,
and the two years' absence in Lucerne and
still more southern cities. Of course this is
mere guesswork; so is every hypothesis until
it is proved. But all the simple commonplaces
of first love, estrangement, separation, and a
renewed betrothal after Elsbeth's early widowhood
with one child, could easily have run a
natural course between 1515 and their marriage,
somewhere about 1520.</p>

<p>As for the inscription,&mdash;it is a detail that
Woltmann thinks represents a repetition of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the one phrase, and that I <ins title="original has imagine it">imagine</ins> to have
suggested what for some reason Holbein did not
wish to proclaim:&mdash;"In all honour. [In all
love.]" But nothing can shake my conviction
that in it we hear the faint far-off echoes from
some belfry in Holbein's own city of &Icirc;s. The
realities of that chime are buried,&mdash;whether
well or ill,&mdash;four hundred years deep in the
seas that roll over that submerged world of his
youth and passion. But living emotion, we
may be sure, went to the writing and the
treasuring of this pledge to Elsbeth or himself;
a pledge redeemed when she became his
wife.</p>

<p>Thus for the altar-piece of 1522 there would
be this portrait of Elsbeth in her girlhood
ready to his hand. But even so, see how he
has idealised it, made a new creature of it, all
compact of exquisite ideals! He has eliminated
the subtle sensuousness which has its
own allure in the drawing. Every trait is
refined, purified, vivified, raised to another
plane of character. Genius has put the inferior
elements into its retort, and transmuted
them to some heavenly metal far enough from
Holbein's home-life.</p>

<p>Throughout all these years, as has been
said, he was busy for the printers also. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
1522 he drew the noble title-page for Petri's
edition of Luther's New Testament, with the
figures of St. Peter and St. Paul at either side,
of which mention has been made. And in
Thomas Wolff's edition of 1523 there is a series
of his designs. His alphabets, borders, illustrations
of all sorts, continued to enrich the
Basel press from this date, and were often
borrowed by printers in other cities. In 1523
there came to Basel that masterly wood-cutter
who has been already referred to,&mdash;Hans L&uuml;tzelburger.
And from this time on, therefore,
Holbein's designs may be seen in their true
beauty.</p>

<p>He had painted, besides portraits of Froben
and others, at least three portraits of Erasmus
by 1524. For in June of this year the latter
writes to his friend Pirkheimer, at N&uuml;rnberg,
to say that he has sent two of these portraits by
the "most accomplished painter" to England;
while the artist himself, he adds, has conveyed
still a third to France.</p>

<p>The smaller of the two sent to England,
two-thirds the size of life, is probably the one
now in the Louvre (<a href="#hpl14">Plate 14</a>). It is a masterpiece
of penetration and technique. Erasmus
is here seen in the most unaffected simplicity
of dress and pose; in profile against a dark-green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
tapestry patterned with light green, and
red and white flowers. The usual scholar's
cap covers his grey hair. The blue-grey eyes
are glancing down at his writing. Studies for
the marvellously painted hands are among the
Louvre drawings. The very Self of the man&mdash;the
lean, strong, <i>thinking</i> countenance,&mdash;the
elusive smile, shrewd, ironical, yet kindly,
stealing out on his lips,&mdash;is alive here by some
necromancy of art.<a name="hpl14" id="hpl14"></a><a name="himg14" id="himg14"></a></p>

<p>The portrait now in the Basel Museum, in
oils on paper, afterwards fastened to the panel,
is in all likelihood that third portrait which
Erasmus told Pirkheimer the painter himself
had taken to France. So that Holbein must
have painted it for, and carried it to, Bonifacius
Amerbach, who was then, in 1524,
finishing a renewed course of study at Avignon.
Probably it was during this visit to
France, too, that he made the spirited sketches
of monuments at Bourges. In that case it
would seem that he struck across by way of
Dijon to the Cathedral City, in connection
with some matter not now to be discovered,
and from there took the great highway to
Avignon by way of Lyons; carrying with
him the gift of his sketches from the monuments
of Duke Jehan of Berri and his wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
These were treasured in Amerbach's collection.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason that sent him abroad
on this journey,&mdash;whether unhappiness at home
or the troubled state of public affairs during the
Peasants' War of 1524 and 1525,&mdash;or whether
he simply had business in France which delayed
him there for a year or two&mdash;at all
events, all records fail as to his wanderings
or work in this long interval. And many circumstances
go to show that it was at this time
that he entered upon the immortal work which
was published at Lyons, by the Trechsel
Brothers, many years later;&mdash;those "Images
of Death" which have borrowed the old name
in popular parlance, and are generally called
Holbein's "Dance" of Death.</p>

<p>Just why the Trechsels did not issue the
publication until 1538 it is impossible to say.
As one of the largest Catholic publishing-houses
of France, they would be governed by
circumstances entirely outside of Holbein's history
or control. But more than one circumstance
presses the conclusion that the designs
were made between 1523 and 1526. And there
is a certain amount of evidence for the belief
that they may have been first struck off in
Germany, possibly by some one of the multifarious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
connections of the Trechsels, as early
as 1527. But this is a large subject, not to be
dealt with as an aside.</p>

<p>All the world knows these wonderful designs;
their beauty of line, power of expression,
and sparkling fancy. Among them all
there are only two where Death is a figure
of violence; and but one,&mdash;the knight, transfixed
by one fell, malignant stroke from behind&mdash;where
Death exhibits positive ferocity. In
both of these,&mdash;the Count, beaten down by his
own great coat-of-arms, is the other,&mdash;it is easy
to read a reflection of the actualities of the
Peasants' War then raging.</p>

<p>For the rest, the grim skeleton wears no unkind
smile; though that he <i>is</i> Death makes it
look a ghastly-enough pleasantry. But toward
the poor and the aged he is better than merry;
he is kind. His fleshless hand is raised in
benediction over the aged woman; and the
bent patriarch leans on his arm, listening to
Death's attendant playing the sweet old melodies
of Long-Ago as he stands on the verge of
the great Silence.</p>

<p>But where a selection must be made, there
are two drawings with their own special claim
to consideration. These are the Ploughman
and the Priest (<a href="#hpl15">Plate 15</a>). The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
former has been cited by Ruskin as an example
of a perfect design for wood-engraving; but
even higher than its art, to my thinking, is its
feeling. To the labourer of this sort,&mdash;poor,
patient, toilworn,&mdash;Holbein's heart is very
gentle. And so is Death&mdash;who muffles up his
harsh features and speeds the heavy plough
with a step like that of Hope. And at the end
of the long, last uphill furrow, see how the
setting sun shines on "God's Acre!"<a name="himg15" id="himg15"></a>

<p>The second selection, the Priest, is its own
proof, if any were needed, of how sharply
Holbein distinguished cloth from cloth. In it,
nearly a decade after he had pointed Erasmus's
satire on the unworthy prelate or the unclean
friar, may plainly be read that reverence for
the true priest which Holbein shared with all
his best friends. In the quaint, quiet street
this solemn procession is too familiar a sight
to draw any spectator from the hearth where
the fire of the Living is blazing so cheerily.
The good Father, very lovingly drawn, casts
his kind glance around as he passes on his
Office with the veiled Pyx carried reverently.
Before him goes Death, his Server, hastening
the last mercy with eager steps. Under his
arm is the tiny glass that has measured the
whole of a mortality; the sands have lost their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
moving charm, and all their dazzle makes but
a little shadow now. In his hand is the bell
that sounds Take heed, Take heed, to the careless;
and Pardon, Peace, to dying ears that
strain to hear it. But largest of all his symbols
is the lamp in his right hand; his own lamp,
the lamp that dissipates Earth's last shadows&mdash;the
Light of Death.</p>

<p>Holbein must have had his own solemn
memories of the Last Office as he drew this
picture of the good parish priest. For it was
just about this time that the Viaticum must
have been administered to his father. In 1526
the then Burgomaster of Basel wrote to the
monastery at Issenheim, where Hans Holbein
the Elder had left his painting implements
behind him years before, in which he recalls to
the Fathers how vainly and how often "our
citizen," Hans the Younger, had applied to get
these costly materials restored to their owner
during his life; or to himself as his father's
heir afterwards. This application was no more
successful than Holbein's own, apparently; and
the painter was told to seek his father's gold
and pigments among the peasants who had
pillaged the monastery.</p>

<p>By 1526 Holbein was back in Basel; but two
works of this year would go to show that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
was little less separated from his wife in Basel
than when away. The first of these, about
one-third life-size, is a portrait of a woman with
a child beside her who grasps an arrow to suggest
the Goddess of Love attended by a wingless
Cupid (<a href="#hpl16">Plate 16</a>). The little red-haired
child does not do much to realise the ideal; but
the woman, though not an ideal Venus, might
nevertheless well pose as a man's goddess. A
"fair" woman in more senses than her colouring.
Her dark-red velvet dress slashed with white;
wide sleeves of dusky gold-coloured silk; her
close-fitting black head-dress embroidered with
gold; the soft seduction of her look; the
welcoming gesture of that pretty palm flung
outward as if to embrace; these are all in
keeping.<a name="hpl16" id="hpl16"></a><a name="himg16" id="himg16"></a></p>

<p>This was a lady whose past career might
have warned a lover that whatever she might
prove as a goddess, she could play but a
fallen angel's part. The annals of Basel knew
her only too well. This was Dorothea, the
daughter of a knight of good old lineage,&mdash;Hans
von Offenburg. But the knight died
while she was quite young, and her mother,
better famed for looks than conduct, married
the girl to a debauched young aristocrat,&mdash;Joachim
von Sultz. His own record is hardly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
less shameless than Dorothea's soon became,&mdash;though
the latter is chiefly in archives of the
"unspeakable" sort. At the time when this
picture was painted she must have been about
two-and-twenty.</p>

<p>Unhappy Holbein, indeed! The temper of
Xantippe herself, if she be but the decent
mother of one's children, might work less
havoc with a life than this embroidered cestus.
But "the German Apelles" was no Greek voluptuary,
ambitious in heathen vices, such as that
other Apelles whose painting of Venus was
said to be his masterpiece. And when Holbein
inscribed his second portrait of Dorothea with
the words <span class="smallcaps">La&iuml;s Corinthiaca</span>, the midsummer
madness must have been already a matter of
scorn and wonder to himself. His whole life
and the works of his life are the negation of
the groves of Corinth.</p>

<p>The paint was not long dry on the Goddess
of Love&mdash;at any rate, her dress was not worn
out&mdash;before he had seen her in her true colours;
"the daughter of the horse-leech, crying Give,
Give."</p>

<p>And so he painted her in 1526 (<a href="#hpl17">Plate 17</a>);
to scourge himself, surely, since she was too
notoriously infamous to be affected by it. As
if in stern scorn of every beauty, every allure,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
he set himself to record them in detail: something
in the spirit with which Macaulay set
himself, "by the blessing of God," to do "full
justice" to the poems of Montgomery. La&iuml;s
is far more beautiful, and far more beautifully
painted, than Venus. No emotion has hurried
the painter's hand or confused his eye this
time. In vain she wears such sadness in her
eyes, such pensive dignity of attitude, such a
wistful smile on her lips. He knows them,
now, for false lights on the wrecker's coast.
No faltering; no turning back. He can even
fit a new head-dress on the lovely hair, and
add the puffed sleeves below the short ones.
He is a painter now; not a lover. And lest
there should be one doubt as to his purpose,
he flings a heap of gold where "Cupid's" little
hand would now seem desecrated, and inscribes
beneath it the name that fits her beauty and
his contempt. The plague was raging in
Basel all through that spring and summer, but
I doubt if Holbein shuddered at its contact
as at the loveliness he painted. The brand
he placed upon it is proof of that&mdash;La&iuml;s
Corinthiaca, the infamous mistress of the
Greek Apelles.<a name="hpl17" id="hpl17"></a><a name="himg17" id="himg17"></a></p>

But in 1526 men sat among the ashes of
far goodlier palaces and larger interests than
personal ones. The party in power was not
friendlier to Art than to the Church of Rome.
In January the Painters' Guild had presented
a petition to the Council,&mdash;humbly praying that
its members, "who had wives and children
depending on their work," might be allowed
to pursue it in Basel! And so hard was
Holbein himself hit by the fanatical excitement
of the time that the Council's account-books
show the paltry wage he was glad to earn for
painting a few shields on some official building
"in the borough of Waldenburg."</p>

<p>Small wonder that an artist such as Holbein
should feel his heart grow sick within him,
and should turn his thoughts with increasing
determination to some fresh field. Even without
the bitterness that now must have edged
the tongue of a wronged wife, or the bitterer
taste of Dead Sea fruit in his own mouth,&mdash;he
must have been driven to try his luck elsewhere.
And of all the invitations urged upon
him, the chances which Erasmus's introductions
could give him in England would probably
offer the greatest promise.</p>

<p>But before he set out with these letters,
in the late summer of 1526, he executed yet one
more great commission for his old friend, Jacob
Meyer zum Hasen, now leader of the Catholic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
party in opposition. This was the work known
now to all the civilised world as "The Meyer
Madonna." For centuries the beautiful picture
which bears this name in the Dresden Gallery
has been cited by every expert authority and
critic as this work. But since the mysterious
appearance of the Darmstadt painting, which
suddenly turned up in a Paris art collector's
possession, from no one knows where in 1822,
the tide of belief has slowly receded from the
Dresden painting. Until now there are only
a few judges who do not hold&mdash;especially since
the public comparison of the two works at
Dresden in 1871&mdash;that the Dresden picture is
"a copy by an inferior hand."</p>

<p>Unquestionably the painting now in the
Schloss at Darmstadt is the earlier version. And
unquestionably, too, the changes introduced in
the Dresden copy,&mdash;the elevated architecture,
slenderer figures, and less happy Child,&mdash;are so
great as to lend weight to the arguments of those
who still claim that no copyist would ever have
made them. But, as has been said, the contention
that the Dresden work is a replica by
Holbein of the older Darmstadt altar-piece, is
now maintained by only a very small minority
of judges. The painting of the Darmstadt
work is admitted by all to be more uniformly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
admirable, more completely carried out; the
details more finished (except in the case of the
Virgin), and the colours richer and more harmonious.
Yet both works should be studied
to appreciate fully their claims and differences
(Plates 18 and 19).<a name="hpl18" id="hpl18"></a><a name="himg18" id="himg18"></a></p>

<p>In the Darmstadt work the Virgin's dress is
wholly different in tone from her robe at
Dresden; otherwise the colouring aims to
be the same in each. Here, in the original
altar-piece, it is a greenish-blue. The lower
sleeves are golden, a line of white at the wrist,
and a filmier one within the bodice. Her
girdle is a rich red; her mantle a greenish-grey.
Over this latter her fair hair streams
like softest sunshine. Above her noble, pity-full
face sits her crown of fine gold and pearls.</p>

<p>The woman kneeling nearest to the Madonna
is commonly believed to be Meyer's first wife,
who had died in 1511, the mother of one child&mdash;a
daughter&mdash;by a previous husband. Between
this stepdaughter and Meyer there was
considerable litigation over her property. The
younger woman, whose chin-cloth is dropped
in the painting though worn like the others in
the drawing for her portrait, is Meyer's second
wife, Dorothea Kannegiesser, whom he married
about 1512, and with whom he was painted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Holbein in 1516. The sombre garments of both
women are echoed by the black of Meyer's
hair and coat, the latter lined with light-brown
fur. Meyer's face, in its manly intensity of
devotional feeling, is a wonderful piece of psychology
in the Darmstadt picture.</p>

<p>In the drawing for the young girl, Anna
Meyer, who kneels beside her mother with
a red rosary in her hands, she has her golden-brown
hair hanging loose down her back, as
befits a girl of thirteen. But in the painting it
is coiled in glossy braids beneath some ceremonial
head-dress; this is richly embroidered
with pearls, with red silk tassel and a wreath
of red and white flowers above it. This head-dress
is painted with much more beautiful
precision in the older work, and the expression
of the girl's face is much more deeply devout;
her hands, too, are decidedly superior to those
of the Dresden work.</p>

<p>This is true also of the carpet, patterned
in red and green, with touches of white and
black, on a ground of deep yellow. The
Dresden carpet is conspicuously inferior in
finish and colour to that of Darmstadt, so
much so that Waagen and others, who believe
the former a replica, think a pupil or assistant
may have been responsible for this and other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
details, which for some reason Holbein himself
was unable to finish.</p>

<p>The elder boy, with the tumbled brown hair,
dressed in a light-brown coat trimmed with
red-brown velvet, and hose of cinnabar-red,
with decorations of gold clasps and tags on
fine blue cords, has a yellowish-green portemonnaie,
with tassels of dull blue hanging
from his girdle. All the carnations are superb,
and in the Darmstadt picture the infant Christ
wears a sweet and happy smile. In that of
Dresden He looks sad and ill; a fact which has
given rise to the theory Ruskin adopted&mdash;that
the Virgin had put down the divine Child and
taken up Meyer's ailing one. But the absence
of wonder on the faces of Meyer's family, and,
indeed, the familiar affection of the elder boy,
would of itself negative this theory. I have
my own ideas as to this point, but it would
serve no useful purpose to go into them in this
place. Of these two sons of Meyer there is
no other record. Anna alone survived her
mother, who married again after Meyer's
death. Anna's daughter married Burgomaster
Remigius F&auml;sch, or Fesch, whose grandson&mdash;Remigius
F&auml;sch, counsellor-at-law&mdash;was the
well-known art collector whose collection and
manuscript are also in the Basel Museum,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
where there is an oil-copy of the Dresden
Meyer-Madonna.</p>

<p>Even the cool eye of Walpole was warmed
by this great work of 1526, as he saw it in the
Dresden painting then hanging in the Palazzo
Delfino at Venice. "For the colouring," he
exclaims, "it is beautiful beyond description;
and the carnations have that enamelled bloom
so peculiar to Holbein, who touched his works
till not a touch remained discernible." Twenty
years earlier Edward Wright had written of
Meyer's youngest boy&mdash;"The little naked boy
could hardly have been outdone, if I may dare
to say such a word, by Raphael himself." And
in our own day that fine and measured critic,
Mrs. Jameson, has spoken for generation upon
generation who have thought the same thought
before the Meyer-Madonna of Dresden, when
she says of it: "In purity, dignity, humility
and intellectual grace this exquisite Madonna
has never been surpassed; not even by
Raphael. The face, once seen, haunts the
memory."</p>

<p>When Wright and Walpole saw this Dresden
work at Venice, it was supposed to be "the
family of Sir Thomas More"&mdash;<i>Meier</i> having
slipped into "More" in the course of centuries,
which had retained only the vivid impression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of Holbein's association with the latter, and
knew that the painter had drawn him in the
midst of his family. That living association
was now, late in the summer of this year, about
to begin.</p>

<p>Two years earlier Erasmus had evidently
thought that London was the true stage
for such a genius as Holbein's, and More had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
written that he would gladly do all he could
to further the painter's success if he should
decide to visit England. More himself called
Holbein "a marvellous artist" for his portrait
of Erasmus, and could not but be delighted
with the beautiful little woodcut which opened
Froben's edition of his own <i>Utopia</i>.</p>

<p>This illustration represents More and his
only son seated with &AElig;gidius, or Peter Gillis,
in the latter's own garden at Antwerp, listening
to the tale of <i>Utopia</i> from the ancient comrade
of Amerigo Vespucci. And very likely Holbein
himself sat in this garden, in the late summer
of 1526, when he was passing through Antwerp
to England. He had a letter of introduction
from Erasmus to &AElig;gidius, as also to the host
who was expecting him in England&mdash;Sir
Thomas More.</p>

<p>Van Mander says that long before this the
Earl of Arundel, when pausing at Basel, had
been so much pleased with Holbein's works in
that city that he had urged the painter to forsake
it for London. But it would pretty surely
have been the promise of More's influence
which actually induced him to try his fortune
so far afield. And by the autumn of 1526 he
was one of that happy company which the
genial soul of More drew around him in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
new home in "Chelsea Village," where Beaufort
Row now has its north end. Here the
master's love of every art, and aptitude in
affairs, filled his hospitable mansion with wit
and music and joyous strenuousness. Here
he was the idol of his family, as well as the
King's friend. Henry himself must surely have
shuddered could he have pictured that face,
over which thought and humour were ever
chasing one another like sun and shadow on
the lawn, black above London Bridge and
flung at last from it into the Thames only a
few years hence. Now it turned to his own
all life and loyalty, as he laid his arm around
More's shoulders while they wandered between
the garden beds of Chelsea.</p>

<p>Early in 1527, probably, Holbein had finished
the fine portrait of his host, which is now in
Mr. Huth's collection. The study for this
oil painting is among the Windsor drawings
(<a href="#hpl20">Plate 20</a>), as also one for the large family
picture now lost, if indeed it was ever completed
by Holbein; a matter of some doubt,
notwithstanding Van Mander's account of it
in the possession of the art-collector Van Loo.
An outline sketch of it, or for it, he certainly
made. And that precious pen-and-ink outline,&mdash;with
the name of each written above or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
below the figure in More's hand, and notes as
to alterations to be made in the final composition
in Holbein's hand,&mdash;is now in the Basel
Museum; having come into Amerbach's possession
as the heir of Erasmus.<a name="hpl20" id="hpl20"></a><a name="himg20" id="himg20"></a></p>

<p>In Mr. Huth's oil portrait More is wearing
a dark-green coat trimmed with fur, and showing
the purple sleeves of his doublet beneath.
His eyes are grey-blue. He never wore a
beard, made the fashion by Henry VIII. at
the same time that the head was "polled,"&mdash;a
singularly ugly combination,&mdash;until he was in
the Tower and grew that beard which he
smilingly swept away from the path of the
executioner's axe. "It," he said with astonishing
self-possession, could be "accused of no
treason." In 1527, however, no shadow of
tragedy seemed possible unless the suspicion
of it slept in More's own heart when he said
to his son-in-law, in answer to some flattering
congratulation on the King's favour, "Son
Roper, if my head could win him a castle in
France, my head should fall."</p>

<p>But for these superb drawings in the Royal
Collection at Windsor, we should know nothing
at all of many a portrait Holbein painted&mdash;all
among the immediate friends of More and
Erasmus on this first visit to England; nor, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
that matter, of many a portrait painted in later
years. And how little these can be trusted to
tell the whole tale of achievement is shown by
the fact that they include no studies for a number
of oil paintings that are still in existence.</p>

<p>Of the drawings which represent a lost
painting, there is a noble one of Bishop
Fisher, whose execution preceded More's by
only a few weeks. A literally venerable head
it was (<a href="#hpl21">Plate 21</a>), to be the shuttlecock of papal
defiance and royal determination not to be
defied with impunity. For assuredly if the life
of the Bishop of Rochester hung in the balance,
as it did, in May, 1535, it was Paul III.'s mad
effrontery in making him a Cardinal while he
was actually in the Tower under his sovereign's
displeasure which heated the King's anger to
white-hot brutality. "Let the Pope send him
a hat," he thundered, "but I will so provide
that he shall wear it on his shoulders, for head
he shall have none to set it on!" And on the
17th of that June he made good the savage
oath. Yet the painter, after all, has been more
potent than the King. For here lives Fisher.
Bishop or Cardinal this is the man, as More
loved him.<a name="hpl21" id="hpl21"></a><a name="himg21" id="himg21"></a></p>

<p>A striking and richly painted oil portrait of
Erasmus's <ins title="original has Mec&aelig;nas">"M&aelig;cenas,"</ins> Archbishop Warham,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
is in the Louvre; of which there are a number
of copies, as well as a replica, at Lambeth
Palace. The latter was exhibited at Manchester
in 1857. The study for these portraits is
among the Windsor drawings. The painting in
the Louvre has more vividness in the carnations,
and the impasto is thicker than at Lambeth;
otherwise the two are identical. But for myself
I find a more seizing quality in the chalk drawing
than in either. There is something in its
sunken fading eyes that speaks of the majesty
of office as well as its burdens.</p>

<p>Holbein painted a prelate of a very different
sort in the oil portrait of John Stokesley,
Bishop of London, which is preserved at
Windsor Castle. And yet he dared to paint
the Truth&mdash;now as always. The painting is a
masterpiece of modelling and soft transparency
of light and shade. But the truculent, lowering
countenance leaves small doubt that the
sitter was a gentleman pre-eminently "gey ill
to live wi'."</p>

<p>There is another oil painting at Windsor
which has not escaped the injuries of time,
but is none the less a splendid survival of
1527. This is the portrait of Sir Henry Guildford,
Master of the Horse to Henry VIII., and
holder of many another office of trust (<a href="#hpl22">Plate 22</a>).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
It has sometimes been thought that the yellow
tone of the complexion was due to over-painting,
but the chalk drawing shows that it was
a personal peculiarity.</p>

<p>Sir Henry, a warm friend to both More and
Erasmus, was forty-nine when he sat for this
portrait. Under his black fur-trimmed surcoat
he wears a doublet of gold brocade. In his
hand is the wand of office as Chamberlain, and
he is decorated with the collar and badge of
the Garter.<a name="hpl22" id="hpl22"></a><a name="himg22" id="himg22"></a></p>

<p>He was always a great favourite with the
King from the time when the latter came to the
throne and young Guildford, then twenty, was
one of the gayest, bravest, most loyal spirits
about it. Always as ready for a real battle as
a mimic one; as clever at writing plays for the
King's amusement as at acting in them; as
good in a revel as at a piece of diplomacy; it is
not much wonder that his knighthood in 1512
should but have been the prelude to a long
series of promotions.</p>

<p>The affection of master and man, too, was
singularly sincere for a court. Sir Henry
loyally supported the King's demand for a
divorce, but he was by no means ready to
support a second marriage without the papal
preliminary. Hence he was not a persona<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
grata to Anne Boleyn. Nor would he stoop to
curry favour at the expense of an honest conviction.
When Anne warned him that he was
likely to lose his office as soon as she became
Queen, he promptly replied that he would spare
her all concern about that, and went straight
to the King to resign the office of Controller.
The latter showed the depth of his affection by
urging Sir Henry, twice, to reconsider his determination.
But he wisely preferred to quit
his apartments under the King's roof,&mdash;without,
however, breaking the bond of mutual attachment.
Five years after this picture was painted
he died; in May, 1532. Holbein also painted
Lady Guildford's portrait; an oil painting in Mr.
Frewer's collection. And Sir Henry selected
him as one of the chief artists commissioned
to decorate the interior of the Banqueting
Hall specially erected for the celebration of
the French Alliance in 1527. By all of which
it would seem that in securing a new patron
the painter had once more made a friend.</p>

<p>Erasmus had asked &AElig;gidius to assist Holbein's
success in any way he could. And it was
probably owing to a letter from the Antwerp
scholar that a friendship of many years sprang
up between the painter and Nicholas Kratzer
of Munich, then Astronomer-Royal at the Court<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of Henry VIII. It began with what was once
a fine portrait. But the oil painting, now in
the Louvre (<a href="#hpl23">Plate 23</a>), has suffered such severe
injuries as to be but a poor ghost of what it
was originally. Only the composition, and the
fidelity with which all his friend's scientific
instruments are drawn attest Holbein. He
never adds a detail for merely pictorial purposes;
and never shuffles one that concerns the
personality of a sitter. No biographer with
his pen sets every straw to show the winds
of character and circumstance more deliberately
than does this historian with his brush.
Something of Kratzer's shrewd wit,&mdash;for he was
a "character"&mdash;can still be read in his half-destroyed
picture. Years later we shall see the
intimate friend of both him and his painter
writing of the astronomer as a man "brim-full"
of humour and fancy. And once, we may
be sure, it sparkled in the eyes of Kratzer's
portrait as brilliantly as in his own.<a name="hpl23" id="hpl23"></a><a name="himg23" id="himg23"></a></p>

<p>In the Munich Gallery there is another portrait
in oils which has undergone, if possible,
still more atrocious treatment than Kratzer's;
yet, like it, still keeps enough of its original
charm to rivet attention in any company.
This latter is one of the most striking of the
half-dozen portraits of Sir Bryan Tuke, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
all claim, with more or less of probability, to
be paintings by Holbein. And certainly in the
years when Sir Bryan was Treasurer of the
King's Household it would be natural that the
painter, whose salary he regularly disbursed,
should gladly oblige him to his utmost.</p>

<p>But the Munich portrait also shows a far
deeper bond of interests than one of money.
The undercurrent of their natures ran in a
groove of more than common sympathy; and
to an analyst, such as Holbein was, the reflections
behind these inscrutable eyes were full of
unusual attraction.</p>

<p>Myself, I feel convinced, for more than one
reason, that it is a work of some years later.
But as a consensus of authorities places it
during this visit, the picture is noticed here.
It gains rather than loses by reproduction;&mdash;since
the painting now shows a strange disagreeable
colour most unlike the carnations of
Holbein. But the composition is unmistakable
(<a href="#hpl24">Plate 24</a>). Between the sitter and the green-curtained
background stands perhaps the
ghastliest of all Holbein's skeletons,&mdash;one hand
on his scythe, the other grimly pointing at the
nearly-spent sands of the hour-glass. Below
the latter is a tablet on which, in Latin, are
the words of Job: "My short life, does it not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
come to an end soon?" and the signature
without the date. Sir Bryan wears a fur-trimmed
doublet with gold buttons; the gold-patterned
sleeves revealed by the black silk
gown, also trimmed with fur. On a massive
gold chain he wears a cross of great richness,
enamelled with the pierced Hands and Feet.
Fine lawn is at throat and wrists; and in one
hand he holds his gloves.<a name="hpl24" id="hpl24"></a><a name="himg24" id="himg24"></a></p>

<p>Before the researches of Eduard His, it used
to be sometimes said that Holbein had virtually
deserted his family when he left Basel in 1526.
We know now, however, that whatever were
the moral wrongs which he suffered or committed,
he never forsook the duty of providing
for his wife and children in no ungenerous proportion
to his means.</p>

<p>The records show that the fruit of his two
years' industry was used to acquire a comfortable
home which remained the property of his
wife. And the inventory of its contents at
Elsbeth's death, some six years after Holbein's
death, proves that this home was to the full as
well furnished and comfortable as was usual
with people of similar condition.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1528 the painter bade farewell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
for ever to Sir Thomas More's gracious
Chelsea home. He took with him the pen-and-ink
sketch for a large picture of More in the
midst of his family, which has been already referred
to. This was for Erasmus, who had temporarily
abandoned Basel,&mdash;now so utterly unlike
the Basel of former years,&mdash;and had sought
the more sympathetic atmosphere of Freiburg.
Bonifacius Amerbach, from the same causes,
was here with Erasmus for some time. So
that something like the old Froben days must
have seemed still about them as the three
friends sat together and talked of all that had
come and gone.</p>

<p>But by the latter part of August Holbein was
back in that now sadly-altered Basel whence
his best friends were reft by trouble or death.
And on the 29th of August, 1528, he bought
the house next to Froben's <i>Buchhaus</i>, the deed
attesting that he did so in person, in company
with Elsbeth. The price, 300 guldens or
florins, was by no means the small one it now
seems, nor could the painter pay the whole
sum at once. He paid down one-third, and
secured the rest by a mortgage. The site of
this house is now occupied by 22 St. Johann
Vorstadt. Three years later, March 28th, 1531,
Holbein bought out a disagreeable neighbour;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and thus added to his two-storied house overlooking
the Rhine the little one-storied cottage
which cost him only seventy guldens. The
factory at No. 20 now partially covers this
latter site. Fifty years ago both of the original
houses were still standing; quaint, crumbling,
affecting monuments of days when Holbein's
voice and Holbein's step rang through their
rooms, when Frau Elsbeth swept and garnished
them; and when four children added their links
to the chain of a marriage which Holbein was
now manfully trying to make the best of.</p>

<p>It must have been in the year after the purchase
of the larger house that he painted the
group of his wife and the two children she had
then borne him. This life-size group, done in
oils on paper, is now in the Basel Museum
(<a href="#hpl25">Plate 25</a>). The stoical sincerity with which
they are represented, and the hard outline produced
by cutting out the work to mount it on
its wood panel, makes a somewhat repellent
impression at the first glance. And this is in
no way dispersed by studying Elsbeth's traits.
But the painting itself is a tour-de-force. By
sheer Quality Holbein has invested these portraits,&mdash;a
middle-aged, coarse-figured, unamiable-looking
woman, a very commonplace
infant, and a bright-faced boy,&mdash;with the prestige<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
inseparable from an achievement of a high
order.<a name="hpl25" id="hpl25"></a><a name="himg25" id="himg25"></a></p>

<p>Clearly Elsbeth Holbein was not one to give
up the costume of her youth simply because
she would have been well advised to do so;
and the cut and fashion of her dress remains
almost identical with the drawing in the Louvre.
Her lustreless light-brown hair is covered with
a gauzy veil and a reddish-brown cap. Her
brown stuff upper garment, trimmed with thin
fur, shows a dark-green dress beneath it. The
baby wears a gown of undyed woollen material,
and the boy a jacket of dark bluish green.</p>

<p>Out of such unpromising materials has the
painter made a picture that would challenge
attention among any. If we knew nothing as
to the identity of this woman, sitting oblivious
of the children at her knee, wrapped in her own
dark thoughts, we should certainly want to
know something of her story and of the story
of the little fellow whose eyes are breathlessly
intent upon some purer, sweeter vision. There
is at Cologne, in a private collection, a deeply
interesting duplicate of this work; also on
paper afterwards mounted on wood, but not
cut out. Unfortunately this latter has suffered
such irremediable injuries that it is quite impossible
now to pronounce upon its claim to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
either the earlier example or a replica; but
good judges have believed it to be by Holbein.
Its chief interest, however, from a biographical
point of view, may be said to lie in the sixteenth-century
writing pasted on at the top. Literally
translated, this runs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
 <p class="noindent">
  "Love towards God consists in Charity.<br />
  Who hath this love can feel no hate."<a href="#fn5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a><a name="fm5r" id="fn5r"></a>
 </p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to see on what grounds Woltmann,
who was inclined to accept the picture
as genuine, should hold the inscription to have
been added by someone desirous of increasing
the value of the work by representing it to be
an allegorical picture of Charity. There was
never a time when the allegory, if accepted,
could have carried the same value as the portraits.
And surely the second line is utterly
inconsistent with the theory. Original or not,
it has a very startling likeness to a plea which
Holbein himself must have urged more than
once, to soften a bitterness his own errors could
not have tended to cure.</p>

<p>When the Basel painting was cut out to be
mounted, the last numeral was lost; so that it
now stands dated 152-. But all the other facts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
put it beyond question that the picture could not
have been done before 1529. The baby of 1522
was now the boy of seven, and his successor
would seem to have been born during the first
months of its father's visit to England, and to
be now some eighteen months old.</p>

<p>It may be as well to say here, once for all, as
much as need be said of Holbein's family. As
already stated, his wife survived him by six
years, dying at Basel in 1549. By her first
marriage she had one son, Franz Schmidt&mdash;who
seems to have been a worthy and successful
man of trade. She was the mother of four
children by her marriage with Holbein;&mdash;Philip,
born 1522; Katharina, 1527; Jacob, about
1530; and K&uuml;negoldt, about 1532.</p>

<p>Some years before the painter's death he took
Philip Holbein to Paris, and there apprenticed
him to the eminent goldsmith, Jerome David,
with whom he remained until a couple of years
after Holbein's death. Later, he somehow drifted
to Lisbon, where he followed his trade until he
settled in the old home of his grandfather and
great-grandfather, Augsburg. In 1611 his son,
Philip Holbein, junior, then "Imperial Court
Jeweller" at Augsburg, petitioned the Emperor
Matthias for letters patent to "confirm" his right
to certain noble arms. The claims put forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
in this document are utterly at variance with
the received belief in Holbein's humble Augsburg
origin. Yet the most expert investigators
who have carefully studied this subject agree
in thinking that this grandson based the genealogical
tree on mythical foundations, and therefore
planted it remote from Augsburg itself.
But be this as it may&mdash;and it seems hard to
reconcile such discrepancies within a century
of the time when both Hans Holbein the Elder
and his son were well-known citizens of Augsburg,&mdash;the
application was successful. Mechel
says that this Philip, who claims descent from
the renowned "painter of Basel," lived in Vienna
during his later years; and that a descendant
of his again got their patent "confirmed" in
1756, with the right to carry the surname of
<i>Holbeinsberg</i>; also that this latter descendant
was made a Knight of the Empire in 1787, as
the noble <i>von Holbeinsberg</i>. So much for the
eldest branch, that of Philip Holbein.</p>

<p>The younger boy, Jacob, was a goldsmith in
London after Holbein's death. The evidence
seems to show that he was never here previous
to that event,&mdash;which of itself may have first
occasioned his coming, though hardly at the
time, as Jacob was not more than thirteen at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
his father's death. A document in existence
proves that he also died in London, about 1552,
and apparently unmarried; at which time his
elder brother, Philip, was still in Lisbon.</p>

<p>Katharina, the elder daughter, the baby of
the Basel painting, seems to have left no
descendants. She married a butcher of Basel
and died in 1590. And in the same year, very
likely from one of the frequent epidemics so
fatal to Basel, died K&uuml;negoldt, Elsbeth's
youngest child. The Merian family of Frankfurt-am-Main
claims an hereditary right to the
artistic gifts of its famous copper-engraver,
Mathew Merian, as descendants of Holbein
through this daughter K&uuml;negoldt, who, when
she died, was the wife of Andreas Syff, a miller,
of Basel. According to the greatest authority
on this subject, Eduard His, to whose exhaustive
researches we owe almost all that is known of
Holbein's family, the Merian claims have not,
so far, been proved by actual archives; but
he is of opinion that there is considerable
circumstantial evidence to support their claim
to be lineal descendants of Holbein through
the female line.</p>

<p>But in 1529, when the family group was
painted, neither Jacob nor K&uuml;negoldt were yet
born; and the painter was much more concerned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
with the anxieties of a living father than with
the shadowy cares of an ancestor.</p>

<p>And dark enough was the outlook in Basel,
where the Lutheran agitation had, as Erasmus
said, "frozen the arts." Before Holbein came
back from England many churches had abjured
all pictures. The tide of religious antagonism
had, as we know, driven both Erasmus and
Bonifacius Amerbach for a time to a Catholic
stronghold; and had driven their old friend
Meyer to do literal battle on behalf of the
Church.</p>

<p>Altar paintings were out of the question.
And Holbein could but devote himself to designs
for the printers and for goldsmiths.
Many beautiful compositions for both crafts
remain to testify of his matured powers and
constant industry. The exquisite designs for
dagger-sheaths, in particular, are rightly counted
among the treasures of art. But in the
summer of 1530 came a commission for the
painter's last great work in Basel. This was
the long-delayed order for the decoration of
that vacant wall in the Council Hall, which
adjoined the house <i>zum Hasen</i>.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, this commission also came
officially through a burgomaster, Jacob Meyer.
But the Meyer of 1530, Meyer "of-the-Stag"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
(<i>zum Hirten</i>), had neither blood nor
sentiments in common with the Meyer under
whom Holbein had done his first work in the
Rathaus. Each headed a party at deadly
issue. For the past year Meyer-of-the-Hare
had vainly tried to turn back the clock or to
stay the iconoclastic fury of the hour. Religious
fanaticism had wrecked him as well as every
beautiful piece of art on which it could lay its
hands. And now at last it mattered nothing
any more so far as he was concerned. The
dreadful harvests that had brought virtual
famine, the earthquake shocks which had unsettled
many a mental as well as material
foundation, the flooding devastations of the
Birsig, the rage of Canton against Canton,
the Civil War ready to begin, Pope or Luther
come by his own,&mdash;it was all one at last to
Meyer zum Hasen, who died just as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;
of earlier years was commissioned to paint the
blank wall.</p>

<p>But something of his spirit, something of
what he himself had been preaching to Basel
in warning and threat for years, seems to have
passed on into the pictures Holbein set before
the Council. The paintings, alas! are no more.
But a fragment or two and the drawings for
them show how truly grand the two works were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
which Holbein had probably already intended
should be his swan-song as Holbein <i>Basiliensis</i>.
He chose for his subjects Rehoboam's
answer to the suffering Israelites: "My little
finger shall be thicker than my father's loins;
my father hath chastised you with whips, but
I will chastise you with scorpions"; and
Samuel prophesying to Saul how dearly he
shall learn that "Rebellion is as the sin of
witchcraft, and stubbornness as an iniquity and
idolatry."</p>

<p>Both subjects are treated in the Great
manner. Rehoboam, leaning forward from his
throned seat with flashing eyes, and his little
finger seeming actually to quiver in the air,
is wonderfully conceived. But the meeting
of Samuel and Saul (<a href="#hpl26">Plate 26</a>) most splendidly
demonstrates how far Holbein towered above
mere portraiture when he had the opportunity.
To picture this drawing in all the beauty of
colour is to realise what we have lost, and
what his just fame has lost, with the utter
destruction of such works.<a name="hpl26" id="hpl26"></a><a name="himg26" id="himg26"></a></p>

<p>Not the greatest of the Italians could have
improved upon the distribution and balance
of this composition. The blazing background,
the sense of a densely crowded host beyond
what the eye can grasp, of captives and captors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
&mdash;all the stupendous crackle and roar and shout
and sudden strained silence of Saul's immediate
followers&mdash;is amply matched by those two
typical protagonists, just then repeating the
old drama with varying fortunes on the world's
new stage. The Secular Arm has been short
in the service of God, as interpreted by his
Vicar; it has thought, in Saul's person, to
win the cause, yet spare its enemies. Vain
is it for him to run with humility, to tell what
he has won and what overcome and done. He
has not destroyed All&mdash;root and branch. For
reasons of personal policy, he has given quarter.
And the Priest, for God, will have none
of his well-meaning excuses, of his good intentions,
his policy, his burnt offerings of half-way
measures;&mdash;"Behold to obey is better than
sacrifice," begins his fierce anathema, "and to
hearken than the fat of rams."</p>

<p>Doubtless the Protestant party read its own
meanings into these texts, when once the pictures
were painted and paid for with seventy-two
good guldens. But two very significant
facts form their own commentary. One is that
the only employment he received from the Council
afterward was to redecorate the old L&auml;llenk&ouml;nig
monstrosity on the bridge!&mdash;and the other, that
as soon as Holbein got his pay for this disgraceful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
commission, a pay he was now much too
hard pressed to refuse, he quietly slipped away
from Basel without taking the Council into his
confidence. Judging from his after conduct
to his family, he probably left the seventy-two
guldens to support his wife and children&mdash;now
four little ones&mdash;until such time as he
could send them more from England; and
took his way once more, in the late autumn
of 1531, with knapsack and paint-brushes for
the journey, to a city that might give him few
walls to cover, but would certainly not set him
to painting the town clock.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things had changed in London also, and
gravely, Holbein found, since he had quitted
Sir Thomas More's home at Chelsea with the
sketch for Erasmus, in the summer of 1528.
He had barely settled himself, in the City this
time, before the struggle between Henry VIII.
and the English Clergy ended in that Convocation
when the latter made its formal
"Submission." And in the same month that
this took place, Sir Henry Guildford died.
Then the three great Acts of Parliament,
which swept away the crying abuses of
"Benefit of Clergy," resurrected the "dead"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
lands (so called because perpetually <i>aliened
in mortmain</i>) by restoring them to the national
circulation of the Sovereign-Will, and turned
the rich stream of Annates or "First-Fruits" of
the bishoprics from the Pope's coffers to the
King's,&mdash;were passed in this year.</p>

<p>This legislation was followed by the solemn
protest and then the death of Archbishop
Warham. So that now of that great and
close quartet of friends,&mdash;Colet, Warham,
More, and Erasmus,&mdash;there were two on either
shore of the last crossing. And More could
already see the dark river ahead. His eye
marked the consequences of the Acts as keenly
as his aged friend Warham had discerned
them on his death-bed; and shortly after the
"Submission," More resigned his great office
as Chancellor.</p>

<p>These seem matters too high to twist the
threads of a poor painter's life. But in reality
Holbein's career was shaped, from many a
year back, by such events as rarely touch the
humble individual directly. All his friends
and all his patrons in this country were carried
far out of reach by 1532; and he must sink
or swim, as they in darker waters, according
to his own powers. That under such unexpected
ill-fortune he did not immediately sink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was due to two things&mdash;the greatness of his
powers, and the circumstance that a trading-company
of Continentals, chiefly German, was
seated in London with immense wealth and
immense influence at its disposal, and that
they were men who knew how to appreciate
Holbein at his worth.</p>

<p>The roots of the Steelyard (<i>Stahlhof</i>), or
"Stilyard," as it is often called in early dramatists,
go far back to the legendary centuries
of English history. From before the time of
Alfred the Great, traders from Germany had
clustered together on the bank of the Thames,
close to where Cannon Street Station now
stands. Amalgamation with the Hanseatic
League, and the necessities and gratitude of
more than one king of England&mdash;but especially
of Edward IV.&mdash;had made of the Steelyard
a company such as only the East India
Company of later centuries may be compared
to. With the world's new geography and
new commercial conditions in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, its methods and its
monopoly of the seas were gradually superseded
by the great seamen of the Elizabethan
era. But in Holbein's time, though already
some of the Hanseatic ships were too overgrown
to pass London Bridge and cast anchor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
at their own docks just above it, there was
scarce a cloud upon the colossal prosperity of
the Steelyard.</p>

<p>Its walled and turreted enclosure, able to
withstand the fiercest assaults of Wat Tyler's
men, stretched from the river northward to
Thames Street, and from Allhallows Street on
the east to Dowgate Street on the west; and
it might well have been described as a German
city and port situated in the heart of the City
of London. Its massive front in Thames
Street, where were its three portcullised and
fortified gateways with German inscriptions
above and the Imperial Double-Eagle high
over all, was one of the sights of London.
And the Steelyard Tavern was a famous resort.
When Holbein knew it well the greatest prelates
and nobles and all the Court crowd,&mdash;which
stretched its gardens and great houses from
the stream of the Fleet, just west of the City
wall, to Westminster Abbey,&mdash;used to flock to
this Thames Street corner of the Steelyard
to drink Rhenish wine and eat smoked reindeer-tongue
and caviar.</p>

<p>Within the gates stood the big Guildhall,
which answered both for its councils and its noted
banquets. The high carved mantelpieces and
wainscotting served admirably to display the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
glittering plate and strange souvenirs of every
known land and sea. On the walls which
Holbein's works were so to enrich hung portraits
of eminent members of the Guild. The
Hall was flanked by the huge stone kitchen
and by a strong-tower for the safeguarding of
special valuables. In the open space between
the Hall and the west wall of the enclosure was
the garden, where trees and flowers and a
greenery of vines had been planted in exact
imitation of the gardens of the Fatherland.
And here sat Holbein among the Associates,
many a time, over their good cheer,&mdash;as in
the old Basel gardens of the Blume or the
Stork in other years, and heard only the
German tongue or the songs of home around
him.</p>

<p>Away down to the docks ran the lanes of
warehouses; shops and booths where every
German trader or craftsman in London had his
place; and where the merchandise of the world&mdash;the
greater part of it destined for L&uuml;beck as
a centre of European distribution&mdash;might be
sampled. Here were choicest specimens of
the then costly spices of Cathay, or the famous
falcons of Norway and Livonia, for which English
sportsmen were willing to pay fabulous
prices.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1418" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>As in other guilds, the government of this
cosmopolitan beehive was that of a despotic
democracy. All the inmates of the precincts
were subjected to a rule little short of monastic
in its strict discipline. The penalties for any
infringement, for drunkenness or dicing or
even for an abusive epithet, were very severe.
The civic duties of the corporation, too, were
sharply defined. In case of war every member
had his appointed post in the defence of
London. Every "master" had to keep the prescribed
accoutrements and arms ready for immediate
use, and the repairs and maintenance
of the Bishop's Gate were at the sole cost of the
Steelyard.</p>

<p>No chapel was erected within its enclosure,
the Guild preferring to be incorporated with
the adjoining parish of Allhallows. Whether
or not there is any truth at the bottom of the
ancient tradition that this church had been
originally founded by Germans, the Guild maintained
its own altar in it in Holbein's time, where
Masses were said on its own special days and
festivals. So far are the facts from the common
supposition that the doctrines of Luther would
find natural favour in such a community, that
the latter only gradually came into the "Church
of England" by the same slow processes which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
transformed the whole parish around it. And
when More, who was anything but <i>Utopian</i>
himself in the practice of tolerating "heresy"
during his chancellorship, headed a domiciliary
visit in search of Lutheran writings, he could
find nothing but orthodox German Prayer-books
and the Scriptures, whose use among laymen
he always strenuously advocated; while every
member of the community was able to make
honest and hearty oath at St. Paul's Cross
that no heretic or heretical doctrine would be
tolerated amongst them.</p>

<p>Here, then, in this staunch citadel of his
own faith, Holbein naturally found a new circle
of friends among whom it must have been
strangely easy to fancy himself back in the
Fischmarkt of his young years, with Froben and
Erasmus and Amerbach and Meyer zum Hasen.</p>

<p>The curtain rings up on his work for the
Steelyard,&mdash;work which covered many years
and more fine paintings than could even be
enumerated here&mdash;with a superlative exhibition
of all his powers. The oil portrait of
Georg Gyze, or George Gisze, as it is often
written, now in the Berlin Gallery (<a href="#hpl27">Plate 27</a>),
inscribed 1532, has called forth the enthusiastic
eulogies of every competent judge. By a piece
of rare good fortune it is in perfect preservation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
The black of the surcoat alone has lost a little
of its first lustre; all the rest is as though it
had left the easel but the other day.<a name="hpl27" id="hpl27"></a><a name="himg27" id="himg27"></a></p>

<p>The young merchant is seated among his
daily surroundings in the Steelyard. He is in
the act of leisurely opening a letter addressed,
"To the hand of the honourable J&ouml;rg Gyze,
my brother, in London, England" (<i>Dem
ersamen herrn J&ouml;rg Gyzen zu Lunden in
Engelant meinem broder to henden</i>). The merchant's
motto, "No pleasure without care," is
chalked up in Latin on the background, with
his signature beneath it. Written on a paper
stuck higher up is a Latin verse in praise of the
portrait; also the date, and the sitter's age&mdash;thirty-four.
On the racks and shelves are documents,
books, keys, a watch and seals, and a pair
of scales. A gold ball is hanging from above
with a lovely chasing in blue enamel; a miracle
of painting in itself, to say nothing of the
exquisite Venetian glass, filled with water and
carnation-pinks. This flower has its own meaning,
and is introduced in more than one of
Holbein's portraits. On the rich oriental table-cloth
are writing materials also, with account-books,
seal and scissors.</p>

<p>Gyze himself is a fair-haired man, wearing
a brilliant red silk doublet beneath his black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
cloak. And the amazing thing is that amidst
this bewildering array of pictures&mdash;for every
article is such in itself, owing to the perfection
of its painting&mdash;Gyze is not lost or overridden
for a moment. It is unmistakably <i>his</i> picture;
and he dominates the accessories as much as
he did in reality. The man, the whole man, is
there; and the things are there around him;
that is all. But that the eye recognises this is
the demonstration of the painter's own mastership.
It is as much Holbein's peculiar secret
as are the cool shadows, the luminous glow,
the astounding elaboration, all made to express
the dignity of one, and but one, theme.</p>

<p>As has been said, the Steelyard portraits are
too many to even catalogue here, covering many
years. But Gyze's may be taken as their high-water
mark. For that matter it could not, in
its own way, be surpassed by any portrait.
Holbein himself greatly surpassed it in the
matter of subtle and noble simplicity, in his
two greatest extant pieces of portraiture&mdash;the
Morett of Dresden and the Duchess of
Milan, now in our National Gallery. But in
technical powers, and the power of subordinating
their very virtuosity to the requirement
of a true picture, this was a superlative expression
of his matured method.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>In the midst of all his fresh London successes
came a summons from Basel, which
must have made the painter smile a little
grimly. It had slowly dawned on the Council
that Holbein&mdash;whose renown they well knew
was a feather in Basel's cap&mdash;was proposing to
make a prolonged absence. The result was a
decision which the Burgomaster officially conveyed
to him. Jacob Meyer zum Hirten wrote
to say that Holbein was desired to return immediately
to resume the duties of a citizen-artist,
and that the Council, anxious to assist
him in the support of his family, had resolved
to allow him an annuity of thirty guldens yearly
"until something better" could be afforded.
Whether he replied in evasive terms, or
whether he let the L&auml;llenk&ouml;nig speak for him,
is not on record.</p>

<p>By the time Holbein received this letter,
written late in the autumn of 1532, he was
plunged into a year of almost incredible
activity. The whole of it would hardly seem
too long for one such painting as the life-size
double portrait&mdash;his largest extant portrait-painting&mdash;that
now belongs to the National
Gallery: "The Ambassadors" (<a href="#hpl28">Plate 28</a>).</p>

<p>At the extremities of a heavy table, something
like a rude dinner-waggon, are two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
full-length figures which show a curious reflection
of his early defect in their want of
sufficient height. At the spectator's left stands
a richly-costumed individual, whose stalwart
proportions, ruddy complexion, and boldly ardent
eye denote the perfection of vigorous
health, and are in striking contrast to the
physique, colouring, and expression of his
companion. The former wears a black velvet
doublet, which reveals an under-garment of
gleaming rose-red satin. Over all is a black
velvet mantle lined and trimmed with white
fur. On his black cap is a silver brooch which
displays a skull. He wears a gold badge
exhibiting a mailed figure spearing a dragon
suspended by a heavy gold chain. The hilt of
his sword is seen at his left hand, and his right
grasps a gold-sheathed dagger. On this latter
is the inscription: <span class="small">&AElig;T. SV&AElig;. 29</span>; and from it
depends a massive green-and-gold silk tassel,
incomparably painted.<a name="hpl28" id="hpl28"></a><a name="himg28" id="himg28"></a></p>

<p>As has been noted, the complexion of the
man at our right is singularly pallid; the eyes
mournfully listless; the skin of his knuckles
drawn into the wrinkles of wasting tissues.
He wears a scholar's cap and gown; the latter
of some chocolate-brown pile, richly patterned,
and lined with brown fur. He holds his gloves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
in his right hand and leans this arm on a
closed book, on the edges of which is the
lettering: <span class="small">&AElig;TATIS SV&AElig; 25</span>.</p>

<p>An oriental cover is spread on the table,
and upon it are a number of the scientific
instruments common to astrology and to the
uses of astronomers like Kratzer, in whose
portrait at the Louvre they are also to be seen.
On the lower shelf are mathematical and
musical instruments and books. The two
latter are opened to display their text conspicuously.
Near the man at our left, and
kept open by a T-square, is the Arithmetic
which Peter Apian, astronomer and globe-maker,
published in 1527. It is opened at a
page in Division, with its German text plainly
legible and identical with the actual page, as
seen in the British Museum's copy of this
edition.</p>

<p>The book nearest the man at our right,
lying beneath the lute, has been also identified
as Luther's Psalm-book with music,&mdash;in which
the German text is by himself and the music
by Johann Walther&mdash;first published in 1524.
Mr. Barclay Squire has shown that the two
hymns could not, however, have faced each
other in reality, as they do in the painting,
without the intervening leaves having been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
purposely suppressed to gain this end. These
hymns are "Come Holy Ghost" (<i>Kom Heiliger
Geyst Herregott</i>) and "Mortal, wouldst thou
live blessedly?" (<i>Mensch wiltu leben seliglich</i>).
In each case the entire verse is given.</p>

<p>The background is a green-diapered damask
curtain most significantly drawn aside to show
a silver crucifix high up in the left-hand corner,
above the man with the dagger and sword.
On the beautiful mosaic pavement is an ugly
object that looks like some dried fish. But
experiments have shown that the French Sale-Catalogues
in which this work first appears in
the eighteenth century&mdash;first, that is, so far as
we can trace it by any records now known&mdash;were
right in calling this a "skull in perspective";
<i>i.e.</i> a skull painted as seen distorted
in a convex mirror. Some hint of its true
character can be gathered, though not much,
by looking at this object from the lower left-hand
corner of the painting, when the exaggerated
length will be seen to be reduced
to something more nearly approaching the
height of the usual "Death's Head."</p>

<p>According to the views which are now
officially accepted by the National Gallery,
the persons of this picture are two French
Catholics. The one at our left is Jean de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Dinteville, Seigneur of Polisy, Bailly of Troyes
and Knight of the French Order of St. Michael,
of which he wears the badge without the
splendid collar&mdash;as was permitted, by a special
statute, to persons in the field, on a journey,
or in a privacy that would not require the full
dress of a state occasion. Jean de Dinteville
was French Ambassador at the Court of Henry
VIII. in 1533; born in 1504, he was then
twenty-nine. He died in 1555.</p>

<p>The man in the scholar's cap and gown is
George de Selve, privately associated with de
Dinteville's mission for a few weeks in the
spring of 1533. He was born in 1508, nominated
Bishop of Lavaur in 1526, and confirmed
in that office in 1529, in which year he was
French Ambassador at the Court of Charles V.
He was twenty-five in 1533, and died in 1541.</p>

<p>For myself, holding convictions concerning
these portraits utterly at variance with any published
opinions&mdash;and that in more than one
vital respect&mdash;I am compelled to limit my
account to the bare record of its appearance
and catalogued description, until prepared to
submit other facts and conclusions to a verdict.</p>

<p>Two portraits in the Hague Gallery, each
with a falcon hooded on the wrist, show to how
much purpose Holbein had studied these birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
in the Steelyard. The one of Robert Cheseman,
done in this year, is especially fine, with a
strange, elusive suggestion of something kindred
in the nature of man and bird.</p>

<p>In 1533, also, the Steelyard placed its contribution
to the celebration of Anne Boleyn's
coronation in the painter's hands. And the
result was, as Stowe tells us, "a costly and
marvellous cunning pageant by the merchants
of the Stilyard, wherein was the Mount
Parnassus, with the Fountaine of Helicon,
which was of white marble; and four streams
without pipe did rise an ell high and mette
together in a little cup above the fountaine;
which fountaine ran abundantly with Rhenish
wine till night. On the mountaine sat Apollo,
and at his feet sat Calliope; and on every side
of the mountaine sate four Muses, playing on
severell sweet instruments."</p>

<p>But of more importance to his living fame
were the two large oil paintings&mdash;the Triumph
of Riches and the Triumph of Poverty&mdash;which
he executed for the Hall of the Steelyard. In
their day they were renowned far and wide;
but they also have slipped into some abyss of
oblivion, perhaps to be yet recovered as miraculously
as was the Solothurn Madonna.</p>

<p>When the Guild was compelled to abandon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the Steelyard, in Queen Elizabeth's reign, the
Hall stood so long unguarded and uncared for
that when it regained possession, under James
I., everything was in a sad state of neglect.
And when the association finally dissolved not
long after, the Hanseatic League agreed to
present these paintings to Henry Prince of
Wales, known, like Charles I., to be a lover
of Art.</p>

<p>If they passed to the possession of the latter,
he must have exchanged them with, or presented
them to, the Earl of Arundel. For in
1627 Sandrart saw them in the collection of the
latter, like his father an enthusiastic admirer of
Holbein's work. After this, one or two vague
notices suggest that they somehow drifted to
Flanders, and thence to Paris. But there every
trace of them is lost. Federigo Zucchero
thought they yielded to no work of the kind,
even among Italian masters; and copied them
from pure admiration. Holbein's drawing for
the Triumph of Riches is in the Louvre Collection.</p>

<p>That he ever painted Anne Boleyn, unless in
miniature, seems doubtful. The portrait among
the Windsor drawings which has been labelled
with her name agrees with no description of
her in any single respect. But in 1534 he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
painted one whose destiny was closely linked to
hers&mdash;Thomas Cromwell, then Master of the
Jewel House.</p>

<p>And it was probably about this time that he
painted what is in some respects the greatest
of all his portraits&mdash;one of the galaxy of
supreme works of all portraiture&mdash;the oil painting
of Morett, or Morette, so long regarded as
a triumph of Leonardo da Vinci's art. The
world knows it well in the Dresden Gallery
(<a href="#hpl29">Plate 29</a>).</p>

<p>The figure is life-size. The pose, even the
costume in its feasible essentials, strikingly
repeats the Whitehall portrait of Henry VIII.,
as copies show this to have been completed
in the wall painting. The background is a
green curtain.<a name="hpl29" id="hpl29"></a><a name="himg29" id="himg29"></a></p>

<p>The sitter wears neither velvet nor cloth-of-gold,
nor Order of any sort; but his costume
is rich black satin, the sleeves puffed with
white, the broad fur collar of sable. In his cap
is a cameo brooch. His buttons are gold; and
a gold locket hangs from a plain, heavy chain
of the same metal. His right hand carries his
gloves, his left rests on the gold sheath of the
dagger that hangs from his waist. His auburn
hair and beard is streaked with grey.</p>

<p>No words, no reproduction, can hope to express<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the qualities of such a painting. Neither
can show the mastery or the spell by which the
green background, the hair, the cool transparent
flesh-tones, the fur, the satin, the gold,
are all woven into a witchery as virile as it is
penetrating.</p>

<p>This is another work which has undergone
more than one transformation in the course of
its records. As late as 1657 it was correctly
ascribed to Holbein in the Modena Collection.
But the first syllable of the sitter's name has
been its only constant. In time Morett slipped
into Moretta, and then&mdash;like <i>Meier</i> in the
Madonna picture&mdash;into Morus. So far it seems
to have clung to some English tradition. But
when Morus got changed to Moro it was but
natural for an Italian to think of Ludovico
Sforza, "Il Moro." Long before this Holbein
had become Olbeno; and thereafter a puzzle.
When the portrait was labelled Sforza, however,
who could its obviously great painter be but
Leonardo? <i>Et voil&agrave;!</i> Thus the work passed
to the Gallery and Catalogue of the Royal
Collection at Dresden. And thus it long remained,
as if to attest the true level of Holbein's
genius.</p>

<p>But when the Gallery also acquired the drawing
of the Arundel Collection, labelled "Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Morett" in Hollar's engraving from it, the
painting was held to be unquestionably identified
by it as Hubert Morett, goldsmith to
Henry VIII. Nor is there anything incongruous
in this belief. Such a master goldsmith
was no tradesman, in our sense of the
word. He was often much more like one of
our merchant princes. The merchants of the
Steelyard were frequently the royal bankers,
and many times were employed on high and
delicate diplomatic missions to other courts.
Neither is there anything in the sitter's dress
to forbid it to a man of this stamp, even after
the sumptuary laws of Henry VIII. were
passed; while there is much, very much, to
suggest an English origin.</p>

<p>On the other hand, M. Larpent has now
shown that the Arundel drawing was down in a
catalogue of 1746-7 as: "One Holbein, Sieur
de Moret, one of the French hostage in England";
and also that a "Chas. sieur de
Morette" is recorded among the four French
hostages sent to England in 1519. It would
thus appear that the painting is a portrait of
Charles de Solier, seigneur de Morette; an
eminent soldier and diplomatist of France; born
in 1480, Ambassador to England more than
once, and finally, in 1534.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Besides all the portraits of Holbein's English
period, many of them scattered throughout the
collections of all Europe, and many others now
lost, it must not be forgotten that he was at
the same time pouring forth miniature paintings,
designs for engraving, designs for the
goldsmith, and conceptions of every sort&mdash;from
a carved chimney-piece to a woman's jewelled
trinket; and all designed with the same exquisite
precision and felicity. In the British
Museum as on the Continent these drawings
are an education in themselves. And besides
the portrait studies in the Windsor Collection
there is a sketch for a large painting which, if
ever executed, is lost: "The Queen of Sheba
visiting King Solomon."</p>

<p>These were years of pleasant friendships,
too, as well as work and cares. Nicholas
Bourbon, scholar and poet, after his sojourn in
London, writes back in 1536: "Greet in my
name as heartily as you can all with whom you
know me to be connected by intercourse and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
friendship." And after mentioning high dignitaries
who had followed the King's example of
showing special courtesies to Bourbon, he
adds: "Mr. Cornelius Heyss, my host, the
King's Goldsmith; Mr. Nicolaus Kratzer, the
King's Astronomer, a man who is brimful of
wit, jest, and humorous fancies; and Mr. Hans,
the Royal Painter, the Apelles of our time. I
wish them from my heart all joy and happiness."
This little pen-picture of Holbein's intimate
circle is a beautiful break in the mists of
centuries&mdash;and shows us what manner of men
they were among whom he had made for himself
an honoured place. We could ill spare it
from the few and meagre records of his life.
It is also the very earliest documentary evidence
of his being in the King's immediate service.</p>

<p>It was in this very year, 1536, that he received
his commission to paint Anne Boleyn's
successor, Jane Seymour, then on the throne
the block had left vacant. The Vienna Gallery
possesses this painting, of which another version
is at Woburn Abbey, and the chalk drawing
at Windsor (Plate 30).<a name="hpl30" id="hpl30"></a><a name="himg30" id="himg30"></a></p>

<p>The Queen was noted for her milk-white
fairness, and Holbein has borrowed the pearly
shadows of the lily in rendering it. The figure
is a little under life-size. Her head-dress and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
robes of silver brocade and royal velvet are
studded with splendid rubies and pearls to
match the jewels on her neck and breast. The
hands are as full of character as of art.</p>

<p>The Queen's portrait may properly be said
to belong to the great wall painting which
Holbein finished in 1537 for the Royal Palace at
Whitehall. But before that date the painter's
inner life had suffered one more great wrench.
At midnight of July 12th, 1536, Erasmus died
in the home that had been his own, except for
the Freiburg interval, ever since John Froben's
death in 1526; a death that had probably
had much to do with Holbein's first departure
from Basel. That event had uprooted the
scholar from the old house <i>zum Sessel</i>, in the
Fischmarkt, and transplanted him to the home of
Froben's son, Hieronymus. The latter house,
then known as <i>zum Luft</i>, is now No. 18, B&auml;umleingasse.
And it was here that Erasmus passed
away, his mind keeping to the last its humour
and its interests in all around him. But no one,
remembering how Fisher and More had died
in the preceding year, can doubt but that the
good old man was very willing to be gone, away
from changed faces and changed ways&mdash;though
Bonifacius Amerbach and young Froben were
as sons to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Basel, for all her differences with him, buried
Erasmus with great honours. But no tablet
could so commemorate him as the noble monument
which Holbein built to him in the title-page
he designed for Hieronymus Froben's
edition of Erasmus's <i>Works</i>, published in 1540.
It is a woodcut of extraordinary beauty. The
full-length figure of the scholar stands in cap
and gown, with one hand resting lightly on the
bust of the god Terminus (the god of immovable
boundary lines, significantly conjoined to
Erasmus's chosen motto: <i>Concedo nulli</i>) and the
other calling attention to this significant emblem
of fixed convictions. Not even the Louvre oil
painting expresses the whole Erasmus quite so
completely or so nobly as this little drawing of
the man whom Holbein had loved and revered
for twenty years; and to whom he owed, in
the first place, the splendid opportunities of
his career in England.</p>

<p>And as he drew it, what ghosts of his own
Past must have clustered around the lean little
figure! What echoes and visions! The Rhine,
the gardens, the clang of the press, the Fischmarkt,
the friendly smiles at Froben's and
Meyer's firesides; his marriage; the stars and
dews and perfume of all his dreams in the years&mdash;those
matchless years of a man's young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
manhood&mdash;when he had walked with angels as
well as peasants, had seen the Way of the
Cross, the Christ in the Grave, and the Risen
Lord even more clearly than the faces of flesh
and blood. <i>Eheu fugaces!</i> "God help thee,
Elia, how art thou sophisticated."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah, well! Those years, and the darker,
sadder years that had led far from them, were
now like his oldest friends&mdash;dead and buried.
The Holbein of 1537 was painting the King of
England on the wall of his Privy Chamber.
There was a place for honest pride as well as
for honest regret in his thoughts.</p>

<p>This painting perished with the palace in the
fire of 1698. Charles II., however, had a
small copy of it made by Leemput. And a
portion of Holbein's original cartoon (<a href="#hpl31">Plate 31</a>)
in chalk and Indian ink, is in the possession of
the Duke of Devonshire&mdash;the face much washed
out by cleaning, and the outline pricked for
transferring to the wall. The figures are life-size,
but Walpole has already noticed how the
massive proportions and solidly-planted pose
of the King heighten the illusion of a Colossus.
Behind him stands the admirably contrasted
figure of Henry VII. The whole composition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
consisted of four portraits; Queen Jane Seymour
opposite her husband, and the King's
mother opposite to, and on a level with,
Henry VII., who stands on the elevation of
the background.<a name="hpl31" id="hpl31"></a><a name="himg31" id="himg31"></a></p>

<p>The pose and costume of Henry VIII. in
the cartoon were, as Leemput's copy shows,
faithfully carried out in the painting; but in
the latter the face was afterwards turned
to the full front view familiar to us in the
many copies of the King's portrait which
so long passed as works of Holbein, on the
strength of reproducing his own painting.
There is no evidence that he ever again painted
Henry VIII. or that he executed any replica of
this portrait. The old copy at Windsor Castle
serves, however, to recall its details of costume;
such as his brown doublet stiff with gold
brocade and scintillating with the gleams of
splendid jewels, his coat of royal red embroidered
with gold thread and lined with ermine
to match the wide collar; his plumed and
jewelled cap; as also the huge gems on collar,
pendant, rings, and the gold-hilted dagger in
its blue velvet sheath.</p>

<p>But Holbein's own portrait of Henry VIII.&mdash;as
shown by the original chalk study from life
now in the Munich Gallery (<a href="#hpl32">Plate 32</a>)&mdash;may in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
all sobriety of speech be called a stupendous
work. Looking at this marvellous drawing
and picturing to one's self those cheeks informed
with pulsing blood, those lips with
breath, those eyes with blue gleams,&mdash;it is easy
to understand that Van Mander was using no
hyperbole when he said that the painting
on the wall of the Privy Chamber made the
stoutest knees to tremble. It was literally, as
he said, "a terrible painting," of which none
of the stupidly-heavy copies that have for the
most part travestied Holbein's work give any
true conception. Many a man could paint
cloth-of-gold and gems; but only once and
again in the centuries comes a man who can
thus paint, not alone the mane and stride of
the lion, but the fires that light his glance, the
roar rushing to his lips. To look long into
these eyes that Holbein had the genius to read
and the firmness to draw, is to feel one's self
in the grip of an insatiable, implacable, yet
leonine soul; a being who, to borrow the
matchless description of Burke's political career,
is "parted asunder in his works like some vast
continent severed by a convulsion of nature;
each portion peopled by its own giant race of
opinions, differing altogether in features and
language, and committed in eternal hostility<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
with one another." And so long as the great
drama of Tudor England enthrals the minds
of men, hard by Shakespeare's supreme name
must be read the name of the painter in
whose pages the actors in that drama have
been compelled themselves to declare themselves.<a name="hpl32" id="hpl32"></a><a name="himg32" id="himg32"></a></p>

<p>To crown the King's pride, and to the no less
intense delight of the whole nation which saw
in this event the rainbow of every promise,
at Hampton Court, on the 12th of October,
1537, Queen Jane Seymour gave birth to the
son who was to reign so briefly as Edward VI.
And it was doubtless in connection with this
happy circumstance that the King commissioned
Holbein's design for a truly royal piece of
goldsmith's work. This drawing, generally
known as "the Jane Seymour cup," is at
Oxford, in the Bodleian Library (<a href="#hpl33">Plate 33</a>).</p>

<p>No sketch of the artist's powers would
be even barely complete without a realising
sense of their versatility. And in this design
Holbein has more than equalled the highest
achievement of his great contemporary,
Benvenuto Cellini, at this time in the service
of the French Court. The initials of the King
and Queen, H. and J., and the exceedingly
judicious motto of the latter&mdash;"Bound to obey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and to serve"&mdash;are recurring devices. But
it is in the originality and unflawed beauty
of the whole&mdash;the springing grace of outline,
the taste and cunning with which flowers of
gold naturally bloom into gems and pearls, the
combination of freest, richest fancy with every
restraint of a pure taste&mdash;that the perfection
of this little masterpiece consists.<a name="hpl33" id="hpl33"></a><a name="himg33" id="himg33"></a></p>

<p>In the midst of all the public rejoicings, the
Te Deums, feasts, and bonfires, came the
thunderclap of the young mother's death.
Some negligence had permitted her to take
cold, and on the twelfth day after his coveted
heir was born, Henry VIII. was once again a
widower. The Court went into deepest mourning
until the 3rd of February. But Thomas
Cromwell was very shortly authorised to take
secret steps to ascertain what Princess might
most suitably fill the late Queen's vacant place
and strengthen the assurance of an unbroken
succession.</p>

<p>Choice fell at first on a Roman Catholic&mdash;Christina,
the sixteen-year-old widow of Francis
Sforza Duke of Milan, who had died in the
autumn of 1535. The upshot of private inquiries
was that Holbein was sent over to Brussels in
March, 1538, to bring back a portrait of this
daughter of Christian of Denmark and niece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of Charles V. And although the painter had
but three hours in which to do it, he did make
what Hutton described as her "very perffight"
image; besides which, said the envoy, the
portrait previously despatched, though painted
in all her state finery, "was but slobbered."</p>

<p>From this "perffight" painting, which could
not have been more than one of his portrait
studies, he afterwards completed that full-length
oil painting which is worthy to rank with his
great Morett portrait. By the kindness of the
Duke of Norfolk, who has lent it, this beautiful
work is now in the National Gallery (<a href="#hpl34">Plate 34</a>).
But unhappily for its best appreciation, to my
thinking at least, it hangs at one side and in
too close proximity to the bold colouring of
"The Ambassadors"; so that its own subtle,
yet reticent superiority is well-nigh shouted
down by its lusty neighbour. It is a picture
to be seen by itself; as it must stand by itself
in the usual inane gallery of women's portraits.</p>

<p>Hutton tells us that the painter who "slobbered"
Christina's portrait had painted her in
full dress. But Holbein's eye was quick to recognise
the values of her everyday dress&mdash;the
widow's costume of Italy&mdash;in enhancing the
distinction of her face and the stately slenderness
of her figure. And so he drew her as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
stood, with a hint of bending forward, her
gloves being restlessly fingered in a shy yet
proud embarrassment, in the first moments
when he saw her.<a name="hpl34" id="hpl34"></a><a name="himg34" id="himg34"></a></p>

<p>The portrait is nearly life-size. Over a plain
black satin dress she wears a gown of the same
material, lined with yellow sable. Her hair
is entirely concealed by a black hood. At her
throat and wrists are plain cambric frills. The
ranging scale of tawny tones&mdash;in the floor, the
gloves, the fur, the golden glint in her brown
eyes&mdash;and the one ruby, on her hand, are the only
colours, except those of her fresh young lips
and skin and the black and white of her costume.
"She is not so white as the late
Queen," wrote Hutton, "but she hath a singular
good countenance, and when she chanceth to
smile there appeareth two pits in her cheeks
and one in her chin, the which becometh her
excellently well."</p>

<p>It is easy to believe that they did, but her
dimples did not chance for Henry VIII. Whether
she really sent him, along with her picture, the
witty refusal credited to her&mdash;that she had but
one head; had she two, one should be at
His Majesty's service&mdash;or whether it was the
Emperor's doing entirely that his niece married
the Duke of Lorraine instead of the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
whose first wife had been Charles V.'s aunt,
there is, at all events, a soft lurking devil
in the demure little face which seems to whisper
that the answer was one which she could have
made an' she would.</p>

<p>Van Mander heard from Holbein's circle a
story which modern pedantry is inclined to
flout. This is, that when an irate nobleman
wanted the painter punished for an affront, the
King hotly exclaimed:&mdash;"Understand, my lord,
that I can make seven earls out of as many
hinds, any day; but out of seven earls I could
not make one such painter as this Holbein."
An eminently ben-trovato story, at all events.
And certain it is that the painter stood sufficiently
high in the royal favour to be despatched
on some special private mission for the King
in the summer of 1538, of which the secret was
so well kept that nothing beyond the record of
payment for it has ever transpired.</p>

<p>From this date Holbein's name is regularly
down in the Royal Accounts. The amounts
drawn total, it has been computed, about
&pound;360 in present value, and would make an
agreeable annual addition to his other earnings.
So that it is little wonder he was not tempted
by the small sum offered by the Basel Council
in 1532. But in 1538 the Council greatly increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the old offer, and was so anxious to
have him among her citizens that the painter
seized the opportunity of his secret mission to
Upper Burgundy, whatever it was, to pay a
flying visit to Basel in the interests of his
family.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="narrow" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His old companions of the Guild of St.
Johann Vorstadt made this visit&mdash;when Holbein
was back among them, as was noted,
"in silk and velvet"&mdash;the occasion of a grand
banquet in his honour. But the real motive
for his visit was to arrange upon what terms
he could meet the Council's wishes. The terms
were far from ungenerous, as is shown by the
contract which followed him back to London.</p>

<p>In this the Council bound itself, in consideration
of the great honour of retaining in their
city a painter "famous beyond all other painters
on account of the riches of his art," and in
further consideration of his promise to make
no absence from Basel more prolonged than
should be really necessary to carry his foreign
commissions to their destination and receive
his pay for them&mdash;to give him an annuity of
fifty guldens, equally whether Holbein should
be ill or well, but only during his own life. In
addition to this, they granted him permission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
to make short visits to specified art-centres,
of which Milan was one, "once, twice, or
thrice, every year." And recognising the impossibility
of his freeing himself from his
English engagements in less than two years,
they also granted him this interval before he
need resume his residence at Basel; and engaged
to pay forty guldens yearly to his wife,
on his behalf, for each of these two years.</p>

<p>There is every probability that Holbein himself
took a goodly sum to Basel to invest for
his family's permanent benefit in one way and
another. For it could only have been as a
part of this gleaning for them that he drew&mdash;as
the Account Books show that he did just
at this juncture&mdash;a whole year's salary in
advance from the Royal Exchequer; seeing
that the same books prove that he was liberally
paid for all his own expenses on the King's
service, in addition to his regular salary.</p>

<p>Part of the sum he collected to take with
him was doubtless used to apprentice his son
Philip, now sixteen, to the goldsmith's trade.
And that the father chose Paris for this purpose,
where he left Philip on his return journey,
might well be due either to his own estimation
of Jerome David, to whom Philip was indentured,
or to the fact that Benvenuto Cellini's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
presence at Paris afforded some advantage;
or that his own promised return to Basel would
make it preferable to have the lad on the same
side of the Channel as all his family. And
that Holbein fully intended to make the necessary
and obvious sacrifice involved in exchanging
London for Basel is also proved by a
contemporary account. "His intention was,"
says his fellow-townsman, "had God lengthened
his life, to paint many of his pictures again at
his own expense, as well as the hall in the
Rathaus. The paintings on the <i>Haus zum
Tanz</i> he pronounced 'pretty good.'" But it
was not to be.</p>

<p>His New Year's offering to the King on the
opening of 1539 was a portrait, probably the
oil painting in the Hague Gallery, of the infant
Prince of Wales. It was a spirited picture
of the royal baby with his gold rattle in his
chubby little fist, such as might have delighted
a father less doting than Henry VIII., whose
return gift is recorded: "To Hans Holbyne,
paynter, a gilte cruse with a cover, weighing
x oz. 1 quarter." The cruse was made by a
friend of the painter; that Cornelius Hayes,
goldsmith, whom Bourbon's letter mentioned
in connection with him in 1536.</p>

<p>All these months the negotiations for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
hand of the Duchess of Milan had fluctuated
with the varying fortunes of the King's relations
with her uncle, Charles V. But at last
they had altogether collapsed with what seemed
to Henry VIII. the threatening attitude assumed
by the Emperor and the Pope. Hereupon followed
that historical chapter, so full of fatal
consequences to Cromwell, and no less big
with shame for the King's own story: the
pitiful chapter of Anne of Cleves.</p>

<p>Her brother, the Duke of Cleves, was at this
time a troublesome foe to the Emperor; while
the fact that she was a Protestant was a
"Roland" for the Imperial and Papal "Oliver."
So Holbein was again posted off to bring back
a counterfeit of Anne, and to carry to her a
miniature of the King. And by the 1st September
he had acquitted himself of the new
mission.</p>

<p>There is not an iota of historical or other
evidence for that "Flanders mare" anecdote,
which seems to have had a gratuitous as well
as spontaneous origin in Bishop Burnet's seventeenth-century
brain, to the effect that the King
was the victim of a flattering portrait by
Holbein, and cruelly undeceived by the actual
looks of his bride. In the first place his agents
wrote to him frankly that the Princess was of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
no great beauty, though not uncomely, and
"never from the ellebowe of the Ladye Duchesse
her Mother," who was said to be most unwilling
to part with her (as a mother might well
be, for the husband in question). The King
was also told that she was quite unskilled in
languages or music, and held, with her mother,
that it was "for a rebuke and an occasion of
lightenesse that great Ladyes shuld be lernyd
or have enye knowledge of musike." And in
the next place even a superficial knowledge
of Holbein would disprove any tradition of
"flattery" from his unflinching, almost brutally
truthful brush. It was hardly likely that the
painter who would not stoop to flatter Bishop
Stokesley, or Henry VIII. himself, would be
swerved from his good faith by Anne of
Cleves.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the painting, in oils on
vellum and mounted on a panel, now in the
Louvre (<a href="#hpl35">Plate 35</a>), is the very embodiment of
contemporary accounts of this Princess. Her
fair-skinned, commonplace, yet "not uncomely"
face looks out placidly at you from the quaint
Flemish head-dress of fine gauze and jewelled
cloth-of-gold. Her inert hands (Holbein's hands
belong to his truth-telling revelations), jewelled
even on the thumb, are listlessly clasped upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
each other; her crimson-velvet dress is heavily
banded with gold and pearl embroidery.<a name="hpl35" id="hpl35"></a><a name="himg35" id="himg35"></a></p>

<p>No Venus certainly, and perhaps somewhat
heavily handicapped by the maternal "elbowe."
But still perfectly in keeping with her descriptions
and making no denial to the French
Ambassador's statement that she was "the
gentlest and kindest" of queens; or to an
English eye-witness who writes that at her
coronation the people all applauded her for
being "so fayre a Ladye, of so goodly a stature
and so womanly a countenance, and in especial
of so good qualities."</p>

<p>The fact is that the King's very cruelty to
this poor girl&mdash;torn from her mother's side and
her Protestant home in D&uuml;rren to be the pawn
of an unscrupulous diplomacy&mdash;was based on
grounds, at least, less infamous than that of a
slave-buyer. After both Cromwell and Holbein
had been well rewarded for their services, the
former lost his head and the Queen her crown
on considerations that took no more account of
her looks than her feelings. The Catholic glass
had risen; the King himself was not ashamed
to avow it; and the Protestant alliance was
therefore an incubus. After some two months
of a queen's and wife's estate, poor Anne of
Cleves was bid to pack her belongings and take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
up a separate establishment as an unmarried
woman. No wonder she fainted when first informed
of such an infamy.</p>

<p>But there was no law in England save the
<i>fiat</i> of Henry VIII. The marriage was pronounced
"null and void," and Anne retired into
private life, on the rigid condition that she
would make no attempt to ever quit England,
with an allowance of &pound;3,000 a year, and the
formal title of the King's "sister." There was
no help for her. Never again for her would
there be the austere joys of D&uuml;rren&mdash;her
mother's side, her own timid dreams of other
companionship, and never the price at which
she had lost them.</p>

<p>At the head of the triumphant anti-Protestant,
anti-Cromwell party stood Thomas Howard,
third Duke of Norfolk, whose portrait, in the
Royal Collection at Windsor, Holbein painted
about this time (<a href="#hpl36">Plate 36</a>). The lean face and
the figure clothed in red stand out strikingly
from the plain green background, although the
painting has suffered not a little injury. The
robe is lined and trimmed with ermine, and over
it is the collar and badge of the Order of the
Garter. In his right hand he holds the gold
baton of his office as Earl Marshal, and in his
left the White Staff of the Lord Chamberlain.<a name="hpl36" id="hpl36"></a><a name="himg36" id="himg36"></a>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>According to Roper, Norfolk, then Earl of
Surrey, was a great friend of Sir Thomas More.
But it would be hard to imagine a greater
contrast than the records of the two men. The
latter a pattern of personal purity and lofty
ideals; the former as venal as the King's
Parliaments, and as unscrupulous in pursuit
of his passions as the King himself.</p>

<p>Norfolk's star of influence had already waxed
and waned with the evil destinies of one niece,
before it arose anew with the fortunes of
another only to plunge sharply after them
into the gulf of ruin. For the present he and
Gardiner, restored to favour with him, were
all-powerful. Their calculations seemed to
prosper, too, beyond their most ambitious
dreams, when, instead of ruling through a
rival to Anne who should be the King's mistress,
they were to rule through a legal
successor. For the King was nothing if not
technically correct; and from the moment when
the fatal royal glance flamed on Catherine
Howard when Gardiner was entertaining him,
nothing would do but she should become his
wife. And thus once more the wild wheel
of Fortune was to make Norfolk uncle to a
Queen of England.</p>

<p>Anne was divorced on the 12th of July, 1540,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
and on the 28th of the same month, on the
very day when Thomas Cromwell was beheaded,
the King married Anne Boleyn's
cousin, Catherine Howard. On the 8th of
August she was proclaimed Queen, and on
the 15th of that month she was publicly
prayed for as such in all the churches of the
realm. Well might she be! Dry your outraged
tears, Anne of Cleves, and give thanks
to God that you are well out of it!</p>

<p>There is a miniature in the Windsor Collection
now believed to be Holbein's portrait of
Catherine Howard. Until recently it was held
to be the portrait of Catherine Parr. But there
is a larger portrait of the former among the
Windsor drawings, a study evidently made for
an oil painting (<a href="#hpl37">Plate 37</a>). By this it seems
that she had auburn hair, hazel eyes, a fair
complexion, and a piquant smile. There is a
painting which accords with this drawing in
the Duke of Buccleuch's collection, but it is
said to be by a French artist.<a name="hpl37" id="hpl37"></a><a name="himg37" id="himg37"></a></p>

<p>In the autumn of this year, 1540, the two
years of absence expired which had been
granted to Holbein by his contract with the
Basel Council. But he had now formed ties
which were too powerful to yield to Basel's.
Those plans of painting again the walls by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
which coming generations would judge him,
the resolve to try again if he and Elsbeth
might not manage to live in peace under one
roof where the children, who were strangers to
him, should come to know and be known by
him in something more than name, were all
relinquished. They must certainly have been
relinquished on some definite mutual understanding,
and at a "compensation" agreed
upon between him and Elsbeth and his step-son,
Franz Schmidt; because it must have been
Holbein himself who enabled Franz, acting on
his mother's behalf, to take over as he did the
entire legacy&mdash;a snug little competency in itself&mdash;to
which Holbein fell heir in this autumn by the
bequest of his uncle, Sigmund Holbein, citizen of
Berne. Philip having been launched by his father
in the goldsmith's craft, there only remained the
second son and two daughters at home. Thus
so far as mere money went, Holbein might
now think himself discharged from the support
of his family, and free to divert his future earnings
from them. And, as has been said, the
Will and Inventory proved at Elsbeth's death,
six years after her husband's, that he had
made no bad provision for them in the matter of
material comforts, however remiss his conduct
in its moral aspects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>The Royal Accounts break off in 1541, but
the Subsidy Roll for the City of London has
a very precious item for Holbein's biography
in the October of this year. This announces
that "Hanns Holbene" is among the "straungers"
then residing in "the Parisshe of Saint
Andrew Undershafte," and that he is assessed
as such.</p>

<p>Not only the Windsor chalk drawings, but
the paintings at Vienna, Berlin, and other
Continental galleries, show the pressure, as
well as the high level of quality, at which he
was now working. These portraits are among
almost his very best, while the one shortly to
be mentioned is quite among them.</p>

<p>By the summer of 1542 the tragedy of
Catherine Howard was over. That Royal
Progress, like more than one of its forerunners,
had become the royal shame. This time it was
a shame so black and so wide that within two
years, after madness and death had purged the
complicity of many, there still remained so
many more involved in the sins and follies of
Norfolk's niece that the ordinary prisons were
unable to contain all that were arraigned; a
shame so bitter that when the proofs of it were
first laid before Henry VIII. the Privy Council
quaked to see him shed tears. It was, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
said with awe, "a strange thing in his
courage!" The guilty woman had her own
tears to shed in expiation; but in the dawn of
February 12th, 1542, she walked to the block
as full of wilful, cheerful audacity, and as careful
of her toilet, as she had ever gone to meet
her royal lover. And so the auburn head of
the King's fifth wife rolled from the axe that
had severed her guilty cousin's.</p>

<p>On July 12th, 1543, the "next" year as it then
began, the King married Catherine Parr. She
had been twice widowed and was about to
marry Sir Thomas Seymour when the King
interfered, and she became his wife instead;
though one can well credit the story that she
tremblingly told him, "It were better to be his
mistress." She was a good woman, a generous
stepmother, and a good wife. But there is
plenty of probability for the assertion that her
own death had been debated with the King
when her wit delayed it, and his death set her
free to marry at last the man from whom the
King had snatched her.</p>

<p>It was formerly believed, as has been said,
that Holbein had painted her miniature&mdash;the
one at Windsor, now declared to be the portrait
of Catherine Howard. About this time he
must have painted the great portrait of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
mention has been made. This is the oil portrait
of Dr. Chamber, the King's physician, now in
the Vienna Gallery (<a href="#hpl38">Plate 38</a>). The sitter was,
as the inscription shows, eighty-eight years
old; and the strong, stern face is full of that
"inward" look which comes to the faces of men
whose meat and drink has been a lifetime of
heavy responsibilities. He had been associated
with the Charter of the College of Physicians
in 1518, and was also instrumental in that
of the Guild of "Barbers and Surgeons," in
1541. And it was probably through him and
Dr. Butts, another physician to the King whom
Holbein had painted and who was likewise a
Master of the new Guild, that he undertook
to paint a large work for their hall&mdash;Henry
VIII. granting their Charter to the Master-Surgeons
kneeling before him.<a name="hpl38" id="hpl38"></a><a name="himg38" id="himg38"></a></p>

<p>This work Holbein did not live to finish; and
it is to-day exceedingly doubtful as to how
much of the smoke-blackened painting is by
him. The very drawing has a woodenness
foreign to his compositions, and much of the
painting is by an evidently inferior hand. But
good judges hold some of the heads to be
undoubtedly his work.</p>

<p>However this may be, with the autumn of
1543 Holbein's life came to a sudden close.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Van Mander, wrong as to the date by eleven
years which have fathered a host of spurious
<i>Holbeins</i> on the Histories of Art, is apparently
right as to the cause of death&mdash;"the Plague."
By the great discovery of Hans Holbein's Will,
found by Mr. Black in 1861 among the archives
of St. Paul's Cathedral, it is proved that
the painter made his Will on October 7th, and
must have died between this and November
29th, 1543, when administration was granted
to one of his executors (the other would seem
to have perished, meanwhile, from the same
epidemic). This surviving executor was an
old friend of the artist, whose portrait, in the
Windsor Gallery, he had painted eleven years
before&mdash;Hans of Antwerp, a master-goldsmith
of the Steelyard.</p>

<p>The Will bears about it evident signs of
having been made in great haste and mental
disturbance. But it accomplished all that Holbein
probably had at heart; that is, the ensuring
that whatsoever moneys could be collected from
his accounts, or by the sale of "all my goodes
and also my horse," should first be applied to
clear a couple of specified debts, and the rest
be managed for the sole benefit of "my two
chylder which be at nurse." From the very
fact that nothing as to the identity or whereabouts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of these babies is mentioned, it is clear
that Holbein relied on the verbal instructions
which he had given to his trusted friends and
to their complete understanding of all the circumstances
as well as of his wishes. He was
only concerned, apparently, that such small
means as could thus be saved for them should
not be permitted to pass to his legal heirs.</p>

<p>No other heirs are mentioned; no other
legacy is made. From the Will alone one who
did not know otherwise would suppose that he
had no other family or relatives in existence.
The Plague left no man in its neighbourhood
much leisure for explanations. Stowe records
that the one of that autumn was such "a
great death" that the Law Courts had to be
transferred to St. Albans. But two things
seem to speak in this curt document. First,
that by the transference of his uncle Sigmund's
little fortune to Franz Schmidt (as
trustee for Elsbeth and the children of her
marriage with Holbein), which the archives
prove took place three years earlier, and by
his other arrangements for his family at Basel
and for Philip at Paris, Holbein held himself
free of any further responsibility for their support,
and, indeed, determined that they should
not obtain possession of the residue in London.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>Secondly, that if the mother of his two
illegitimate children had lived with him in
London as his wife, she must have just died&mdash;perhaps
in childbed, perhaps of the Plague.
She is not in any way referred to. And
there is something in the very signs of confusion
and distress throughout the wording of
the Will which seems to exhale a far-away
anguish&mdash;sudden parting, sad apprehensions,
keenest anxiety for "my two chylder which be
at nurse." There comes before the eye a picture
of the five grave men&mdash;Holbein, his two
executors, the one a goldsmith, the other an
armourer, and his two witnesses, a "merchaunte"
and a "paynter"&mdash;hurrying along the
plague-infected streets to get this document
legalised as some protection for two motherless
babies, in the event of their father's death.
No man knew whose turn would come within
the hour.</p>

<p>And by November 29th Holbein's had come,
and one executor's also, apparently. The Latin
record of administration on this date is that it
has been consigned to John Anwarpe (Johann
or Hans of Antwerp), and accepted by him in
accordance with "the last will of John, alias
Hans Holbein, recently deceased in the parish
of Saint Andrew Undershaft."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>It would seem probable, then, that the
painter was buried in this church rather than in
the closely adjoining church of Saint Catharine-Cree
to which tradition assigned his body. But
the horrors of such an epidemic as that in
which the painter was swept suddenly away
make it easy to understand how even such
a man as he had now become could die unnoticed
and be buried in an unrecorded grave.
When the Earl of Arundel, a few years later,
sought to learn where he might set up a monument
to one he so greatly admired, there was
only this vague and uncorroborated rumour that
the painter was buried in Saint Catharine-Cree.
And so no monument was built to mark the
spot where Holbein's "measure of sliding sand"
had been spilled at last.</p>

<p>But, as they ran, those sands had measured
more than "<i>a great portrait-painter</i>." They
had measured Greatness; greatness which is
not to be delimited by the wanton outrages of
man or the accidents of time. Both have had
their share in the judgments of generations
that have lost all his greatest and nearly all his
imaginative creations. And what the Spoiler
has spared, the self-styled Restorer has too
often ruined. Self-love, on the other hand,
and family pride have been engaged to preserve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
those portraits by which it is now the fashion
to mulct him of his far larger dues.</p>

<p>Of his mysticism, of the symbolism in which
his "Journal Intime" is written in his own firm
cipher, this little book is not the place to speak;
though for those who have once come to know
the true Holbein these have a spell, a stern,
inexhaustible enchantment all their own.</p>

<p>But study the few fortunate survivals of his
imaginative works, study even more the wrecks
and skeletons of his loftier conceptions, and ask
yourself if it could be by only a quick eye and a
clever hand (and he had both, assuredly) that
Holbein caught up the dying ember of the Van
Eycks' torch and fanned it by his originality, his
fancy, his winged realism, until its light lit up
the dim ways of Man with a clairvoyance far
beyond theirs. This eye, this mind, flung its
gleaming penetration into every covert of
the soul and deep, deep, deep into the most
shrouded, the most shuddering secrets of
Mortality.</p>

<p>Was it by virtue of a mere portrait-painter's
powers that the son of the Augsburg Bohemian
came to lay his finger upon the very core and
composition of perhaps the haughtiest, the subtlest,
the most dread despot since the C&aelig;sars?
Henry VIII. and Fisher; the La&iuml;s Corinthiaca,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the Duchess of Milan, his brooding wife;
dancing children, and dancing Death; Christ
on the Cross, Christ in the Grave, Christ Arisen;
lambs in the fields, woods and hills, gaping
peasants, wild battle;&mdash;put them side by side,
the poor ghosts of them left to us, and compute
the range of art&mdash;"the majestic range" that
framed them all.</p>

<p>Let us be just. Let us forget for a moment
the chirp of the family housekeeper over her
gods. Let us gather up the broken fragments
that are more than the meal, and humbly own
the Miracle that created them. It is idle to
argue with the intelligence that can see "a
want of imagination" in Holbein. But we can
find proof and to spare that it is not so; that his
so-called "limitations"&mdash;apart from method,
which is a matter of Epoch&mdash;are due to a
creed we may or may not agree with, but surely
must respect. The creed that Beauty is the
framework, the ornament, rather than the substance
of things; the pleasure, not the purpose
of "this mortal"; and that the sweetest flower
that blows is but an exquisite moment of transfigured
clay.</p>

<p>He smells the mould above the rose; yet
how he draws the rose! The brazen arrogance
of pomp, the pearl on a woman's neck, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
shimmer of a breaking bubble, the wrinkles in
a baby's foot, the beauty of life, the pathos
of life, the irony and the lust of life,&mdash;he has
painted them all, as he saw them all, in the
phantasmagoric Procession of Being betwixt
garret and throne.</p>

<p>He has painted each, too, with that genius
for seizing the essential quality which <i>is</i> the
thing, that never forsook him from Augsburg
to Saint Andrew's Undershaft; that singular,
vivid, original genius which can well afford to
let his grave be forgotten, whose works build
for him, as Hans Holbein&mdash;</p>
